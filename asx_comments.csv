0,"Ok so here's what I think (please don't take offense - but I'll take a hard line):

You mention a lot about yourself here and your past performance, however little about your case for purchasing ELO. I may be wrong, but this indicates to me you might not have a strong case (if so, please share your thesis so we can poke holes at it). 

Don't look at your past 'mistakes' - you didn't put more into them as you couldn't tolerate the risk. If you can afford the $2000 now - i.e. losing it wouldn't be the end of the world - (idk your financial situation fully), and fully back the company (you don't mention anything about why you want to buy ELO), then there's no reason why you shouldn't buy more of this stock. 

But the key thing is, know why you are buying - it's got to be a fairly solid thesis imo - have an expectation of what you'd like the company to achieve in 6 months time (or whenever) and continually assess. ",8,0
1,"Tell me your argument as to why it's a good investment.

I had never heard to ELO 5 minutes ago.  Looking at the H1 FY18 accounts.... Revenue 10m. Profit(loss) -$0.6m.  NTA $54m.

Current Market Value $314m

75% of the shares are own by three shareholders (presumably related in some way - not institutions).  ELO have purchased other companies - never a good sign for tightly held companies.

I will never look at this company again.  Nothing in the first 5 minutes of looking at this shows me anything remotely interesting.   

So, give me just one reason why I should even spend time looking this company.

Maybe ?

10,000's of people are out of work. On paper they are still employed because of $130,000,000,000 from the government. But when business resumes, the uptake wont be instant and loads of these people will go from 'stood down' to unemployed. The consequences from this are being understated. People with jobs will reduce discretionary spending. Large household name companies will go under. Retail will be hit hard - sorry AfterPay investors :(. Maybe people will have to sell their negative equity properties. It won't be fun.

Now; the timeline of these events come into question - can I stomach holding BBOZ for this long ? (aka: can the market remain irrational longer then I can solvent ? (>!they can!!<)). I'm not sure, maybe in a few days I'll reduce my position and accept a loss on the parcels I bought a few weeks ago (I guess that is the stop loss you mention), which are currently offset by gains from the very early parcels I bought.

The fight here is between people who invest on emotions and people who invest on statistics. Long term, statistics will always win. Short term, emotions usually win (or lose - in any event, will have greater gains or losses).  

What is 'long term' and what is 'short term' - well, an interesting question. 

Its fine to be one or the other or both in part.  Speculate/trade and also invest. Doesnt have to be all one or all the other. 

And emotions are important - if you are stressed about the market then not investing may be the best thing for you emotionally; the thought of perhaps losing some gains that will show up in 10 years doesnt pay for the cost of your stress today.

1. What do I do with this BBUS/BBOZ that isn't going up, help me
2. When is the best time to buy, I'm not trying to pick the bottom but I just want to know when to buy. 

These are both speculation, you are guessing which way the market is going to go which no one knows. If you are going to try to time entry/exit with long or short positions you need to be conscious of what you are doing. This is VERY different to a buy and hold strategy (a bet that the market will rise in the very long term)

For the love of god if you do buy BBOZ or BBUS set a stop loss or have a system in place for when you get out of the trade in the event of a gain OR a loss.   
For everyone that wants to buy, do so slowly over time. Don't pick the bottom and don't put your entire lump sum in now. History tells us lump sum and DCA work out very similar but good luck sleeping through your entire lump sum experiencing 3-6% daily losses/gains.

If your looking at what is best strictly from a financial point of view, I would just stick it in a savings account with a 2% or higher interest rate (some quick google-fu will help you find some) and watch your nest egg grow with regular deposits.

0,"I took about a month, reading up on what platforms were best to use and why, understanding some commonly used terms by googling them (ex-dividend date, PE ratio etc).

Honestly most of the learning comes from doing and experience. You'll slowly (or quickly if you're lucky) work out what strategy works for you.

For example, I spent a lot of time reading financial reports to understand what qualities in a company I liked (healthy gross margin, limited debt or at least healthy debt coverage with cash and receivables, steady revenue growth), and that'll differ from investor to investor (some people don't like companies who hold cash because it can appear like the company doesn't know how to invest it and it's a waste, for example).

I think a few consistent things I've been recommended and recommend to others are:

* Never invest funds that you wouldn't be okay if it hit zero (which can happen!)
* Invest in what you know and can understand. I too bought A2M as another commenter. I bought it because I could see a lot of my friends were developing lactose intolerances (which didn't seem to be much of a discussed issue a decade or two earlier), baby formula was a big thing (still is) and they didn't have a crazy amount of debt. Ticked my boxes and I went in. People were hyping Lithium miners when I started investing, and I didn't understand how valuations could work for a miner who was prospecting and didn't actually dig any minerals out of the ground yet. They went boom and now look at most of them. You don't need to have a crystal ball, but if you can understand a business and how their prospects apply to everyday life, it's not a bad way to start looking at companies. It's like, if you think the housing market is in trouble now, would you invest in [realestate.com.au](https://realestate.com.au)? No right?
* Stick to your convictions, but know when to pull the pin. Set a bottom out price that you're willing to weather on the chance you got an assumption about a company wrong, and also set an upward sell price (even if it's only taking your cost off the table). Everything in between is you riding the ups and downs of sentiment changes
* Just because something is at an all time low, doesn't mean it's cheap and a good buy. Also, just because something is at an all time high, doesn't mean it won't come down. People are looking at big blue chips at the moment because of the market downturn, everything's become ""cheap"". But little to no economic data has come out yet to back up valuations right now, so it's hard to say whether these are truly cheap or not. You might buy CBA today at $60 because it's the biggest bank and not long ago it was $90, so it should survive right? Well it goes back to point 2, if you don't know enough about the bank and how it makes money, not worth risking the money simply because it's at 52 week lows
* If you're not confident, start with Index ETFs (google the definition!). They are way safer and gives you diversity amongst companies and markets (vs investing in a single ASX company)
* Never trust stock picking advice from others. They are just as good/bad as you are, the difference is experience levels (but experience is not always a good thing). I've been told so many stock tips over the years, in businesses I don't understand, because it was what was ""hot"". Most of those have collapsed (or at least share price has) since. Use these stock tips to broaden your horizon for businesses to research and understand.

Just an update: I've checked my CommSec account this morning and my AVHDA are now AVH. 
Thanks everyone for the replies. Cheers!",2,0
4,"Hi,

I have an odd question regarding my AVH shares. On my CommSec account I currently hold 1,000 AVHDA shares (or CDIs... the whole redomicile process is new territory for me). 

My share registry account shows the holdings as: 

AVITA THERAPEUTICS,INC. (AVH)                               
CHESS DEPOSITARY INTERESTS 

1,000    $8.94   30/06/2020    

So I have two questions: 

1) Can I convert my AVHDA to ASX: AVH? I would much prefer to hold my shares as ordinary fully paid. 

2) If the above answer is ""no"", how do I sell these shares for when I decide it's time? The AVHDA listing is showing as chi-x suspended with not a single unit moving today. However ASX:AVH has been active all day. 

I could be jumping the gun with these questions as the new AVH listing is showing as ""reconstructed"".  I'm just concerned that I may have done something wrong on my end and will be stuck with these CDI units.",3,1

3,"The view from a fund manager (Wilson Asset Management) posted on Livewiremarkets a couple of weeks ago is that it's being sold down due to potential exposure to business interruption claims.

Background: IAG's business interruption policies excludes interruption caused by pandemics listed in the Quarantine Act of 1908. Problem is, this piece of legislation doesn't exist having been repealed some years ago, so small business owners are saying the exclusion doesn't apply and IAG must replace their lost revenue caused by the covid lockdowns. There will be a court case to decide if IAG, and other insurers in a similar situation, will have to pay up.

FWIW, Wilson thinks the market is overestimating the costs that may arise from this issue and thinks the stock will go up when the issue is resolved.

I do not think the sell down is caused by interest rates or bushfires, because that is old information that applied just as much early this year when the share price was $6-$7 as it does now.",1,0

My question is - is there a trading platform that enables investment in Australian Equities and ETF's by way of a joint trading account, part-owned by both an individual and a trust?
