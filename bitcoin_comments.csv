I was about to subscribe to the idea that Bitcoin supply is inelastic and that could influence the price positively even if it is currently inflating at a constant rate. But the supply that actually matters, is the supply on the exchanges. And this is an elastic supply. For example, there is an abundance of Bitcoin on the exchanges at the moment, because ETH has been doing so well, and people have been making loads of BTC. So there is an oversupply of BTC because everyone is making money on ETH it seems. This causes downward pressure on BTC-Fiat price, because fiat is still the go-to currency if you want to consume. And the people who took profit, are expected to cash some of it out. Which is why BTC->Fiat is likely going down. However, in the beginning when ETH peaked, it was some serious drops. People didnt care, they just wanted some cash, right now. But right now, it seems they are timing it. Everytime there is a top, there is a sell.  The next phase will be, that every time there is a top, there is going to hodling instead, because most of the excess BTC will have changed hands into the hodlers.",2,0

Unfortunately merchants in America have a habit of passing on the costs to *all* consumers, even the ones who don't pay by credit card.

Effectively, the consumers who pay by cash or bitcoin are subsidizing the consumers who pay by credit card. That is not the fault of bitcoin, because it's 100% up to the merchants which payment system they subsidize or penalize.

You got the wrong idea about what bitcoin is, either on your own, or from someone who does not understand the economics of what is going on here.

The primary short-term value to be had by most users of bitcoin is to be found in speculation.  The holders among us understand that the production of money (without a state decreeing it such by fiat) is something of a public good and fraught with free-rider problems and other externalities.  Holding, among other tactics is a commitment strategy to help overcome these problems more quickly.  With network goods (of which money being the most network-reliant good) demand begets demand, until such time as the token is held widely enough that it can naturally transition into the primary unit of indirect exchange, and then the demand to hold as money augments the liquidity built up by those holding for other reasons, and the price stabilizes in something of a positive feedback loop.

We are not there yet.  Whether or not the Bitcoin network will facilitate the on-chain throughput and ease of user experience to be the payment network of choice for coffee and other everyday retail items, is irrelevant to the primary value proposition of the logical ends of the technology and network effects which have been built up thus far (towards the ends of a unit-of-account money).",9,0

It has to do with the fact that you are dealing with a system of fees and bs because you are dealing with companies that need to profit off the buying and selling of bitcoin. Just like if you needed to buy some euro with your usd.

Do some work that earns you bitcoins. Ask to be paid in bitcoin and let your employer/contract deal with the fees. Then use those bitcoins somewhere that actually accepts bitcoins, and not through a payment processor.

That is true bitcoin and is not full of hidden costs everywhere. It's the dreamy future of a bitcoin holder. We aren't there yet, but being able to liquidate back into the economy by buying something immediately, just as you would buy with credit card, is going to be the most expensive way to spend your bitcoins, this is because credit cards put the cost of the merchant. There isn't any bitcoin payment processors that do that right now.

Also, bitpay uses an algorithm to determine it's bitcoin price based on daily averages (I believe.. or something like that) it's never going to match any one exchange rate exactly. Just as all exchanges usually are a few bucks off of each other.

I'm not a big spender, but if you want to rely on $800 of credit only for a vacation, that can be risky. You know how you're always supposed to have money for an emergency? Well, what if you did have an emergency? Would $800 be enough? Would you be able to change your flight in case of a family emergency you had to get back to?

Let's take a card I have, the Chase Sapphire card. I have $8000 of credit on there. Not huge, but not small either. I'm not going to put $7200 on the card and hope I have enough to survive on my vacation. I'd use a second card if needed.

You don't have to pay up because your credit card (MC, Visa, Discover, AMEX) all have zero liability protection. You don't have to pay while they are investigating it. So no, you're not spending money you don't have and no one is pulling money from your account without authorization.

Look, there's plenty of reasons to not like credit cards, but I honestly think you maybe didn't manage your personal finances properly to begin with. If you don't want to open up a line of credit, that's fine, because there's plenty of us out there who are enjoying great cashback rewards.",8,0

0,"Here's my standard explanation for why I believe Bitcoin to be so revolutionary and important.

The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand *money*. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one *actually* wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are ""just data."" But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs). 

To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is *de*centralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the ""ledger"" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the ""accounting entries"" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective. 

Enter Bitcoin.

 It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than ""modern"" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn't, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.",5,0

Furthermore you can send bitcoin to anyone in the world (if there's an Internet connection) very quickly, that's why it is useful.",5,0
2,"Bitcoin is a currency designed to be universally usable, require no trust and not be reliant on any single party for its operation.

Having a universal standard empowers progress, not requiring counter-party risk empowers individual liberty.

Look for example at standard weights and measures, imagine if every country built everything to its own measuring system, how much waste there would be. Imagine a country where you had to have a license to publish your thoughts to someone else, how suppressive that would be to progress.

3,"It's a new form of money that, by its design, can't be controlled or influenced by a government. For the first time, people are able to conduct business and transact directly with each other. All other methods of payment are government-sanctioned, meaning that you must have their permission to conduct your business. 

With Bitcoin, there is no third party. The entire system is built in such a way that it is, at the present moment, extremely difficult if not impossible to influence it, like the US government can just decide to print boatloads of cash. 

The power is with the people now ",1,0
4,"If you've never thought about money - where it comes from, why it has value, and the many often invisible ways in which it controls your life - Bitcoin isn't going to be interesting at all. Until many more people are using it, that is.

If you have thought about money, Bitcoin will be much more interesting.

Many people tried from the early 1990s into 2009 to create systems of money based on software rather than edict, and all failed.

The fundamental problem was digital scarcity. It's easy to devise a digital token that two parties agree has some value. A computer file or even a simple text message will do. The problem is how to prevent that token from being copied and spent more than once.

Bitcoin solves that problem and so represents a fundamental advance in both computer science and economics. In fact, it brings the two fields together in a completely new way.

2,"Caveat: I'm not a programmer, but I do work a lot with keys and key management.

Based on your post, I'm not sure if you're using seeds or independent private keys. I'll assume for this post you're thinking of using a single seed with multiple wallets and I'm about to explain why I think it's a bad idea. (Also, I'm not talking about restoring one seed to another wallet and then using that one wallet)

One serious risk is that by simultaneously using multiple, unrelated, uncoordinated wallet providers you are taking on the risk of unknown ""bugs"" creeping up. In other words, programmers make choices within the context of their programs. These choices are not universal, all wallets do not implement the same features - for example the same way of calculating fees, the same way of generating and using change addresses. There are standards that provide guidance but when you actually look at them, there is a LOT of room for interpretation as to how you would implement them within existing wallets. If you begin using different wallet providers, with different implementations, I think there is a significant chance that *something* will go wrong. And if it does, it will be your fault - not the multiple wallet company's -because they don't generally anticipate (nor do they design for) users to use keys in this way. Also, you could run into issues with gap limits (described below).

To your questions, in theory, Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients (most wallets) should check UTXO (for bitcoin associated with your keys) each time you open the app or launch the browser extension or website. Change addresses are built, like your other receive addresses, from the seed. For many implementations the ""import wallet"" function is different from the day-to-day SPV client function. Meaning the only time a larger ""look for"" UTXO function runs is at import. 

It's impossible for wallet software to check every possible address for a given seed - there are 2B plus possible keys per branch per child. So it's my understanding that programmers set a ""gap limit"" - in order to enable them to find keys with UTXO associated. Ever notice that some wallets won't let you create new addresses until you've used the previous one? The gap limit is why. When restoring a wallet (or importing, or sweeping a wallet), the software first needs to identify what keys on the tree have UTXO locked to them. It can't search everywhere, so it searches for addresses in a specific way (based upon standards and how the wallet itself provides addresses to users). It will start at the beginning of each branch that the programmers expected might have UTXO (for example 44'/0'/0'/0/1 branch) and it might look at the first 15 public addresses (for example, 15 is not a required number). If there is no UTXO locked to any of those addresses, the software interprets that to mean the branch is unused and will not continue checking down that branch (remember it can't check every address). This could pose a problem because if you use different wallets and they each use different branches and implement different gap limits, then the wallets might not ""see"" all of your UTXO. They might not even look at other branches after you import your seed. 

One of the other commenters said that their family uses Mycelium shared. In this context, that poses less of a problem because the choices of the Mycelium programmers are consistent with all uses. There is still the risk of loss of one device but it seems they are comfortable with that risk. It's much more likely you'll have trouble if you use multiple wallet providers, which I think is what you were asking about. 

If you give us more about what you're trying to accomplish then maybe there are other, safer ways to do it. I'm sure I haven't covered all of the risks and there are probably other issues too but hopefully you'll get a better idea of why I think this isn't being used more often. Also, each time you type in your seed words, they are less secure - due to key loggers etc. I really like hardware wallets for key management, if you haven't considered them yet, maybe take a look.

I never know when I might want to spend Bitcoins and as I only have a few it is not really practical for me to just have multiple wallets and split my coins between them. So I had the idea of exporting my private keys and importing them to my other wallets. In theory this should work and all wallets should show the same amount of Bitcoins. Also my spendings should synchronize back to my other wallets and reflect the amount I actually still own, or is there anything I am overlooking? Will this pose a problem if change gets involved? I could imagine that only the client I spend the money from would know about the change and the others show a lower Bitcoin total until I export the newly generated private key to my other wallets as well.

I got a call back early this morning. They didn't change their decision or anything and it was explained to me that the account was closed because I made ""bitcoin related transactions"" which would be sending some money to my personal coinbase account.

Our key conclusions are that; 1) bitcoin is likely to remain a niche payment network and unlikely to gain mainstream adoption, and 2) we see little scope for blockchain technology to disrupt the back-end architecture given that card acceptance already takes place instantly and card schemes provide invaluable dispute management which is difficult for a new technology to disintermediate.

...note eight key challenges that have the potential to limit the utility, and therefore reduce adoption, of blockchain systems.

Security vs Cost trade off: The security of the bitcoin blockchain is ensured by syntactic rules and computational barriers to mining. Permissioned architectures are cheaper to run, but as we increase our trust in permissioned authors, we lose the distribution which is a guarantee of ledger integrity

In my opinion, the 2017 Italian banking crisis will pass quietly, it will be a case of lend and extend.
I think most of us believe there is a huge world debt crisis coming but it may be a bigger event like Deutsche Bank crash, Stock market crash, housing market crash that  that causes it. 
During that big crisis it will not be bank bailouts but bail-ins where they take depositors money and we get cash withdrawal limits to keep the system going -that's when we all assume Bitcoin will see colossal gains. So long term I think yes Bitcoin is a good investment at that price but you would may to be patient (years).

""Or are we still anticipating a January correction once speculators go?""
With the current financial system mess with no real price discovery mechanism - who knows what the correct price of Bitcoins are? I recommend you average in and buy a set amount of Bitcoins every month so you are not too exposed to price swings.

9,"Italy's banking crisis is likely to get going in 2017. However, like the this long-and-drawn-out economic collapse that is currently unfolding, it could happen later. Either way it'll hurt the Euro (which will actually help the European economy briefly). I watch these banks and many other financial products that are related to these banks. I can tell you that the banks will be bailed out and it'll hurt the Euro. And I feel it'll happen in 2017 (but it could be delayed with ""massive infrastructure spending""). Yeah..bitcoin will go up. In January? That one I don't know. Maybe. Will it be up by the end of 2017? Yeah. Almost certainly. Will it be because of the Italian banking crisis? Sort of....plus all the other financial engineering projects that are currently unwinding.

The ETF...it won't get approved. Why would our government allow this to get approved? I mean...seriously. Bitcoin is mostly used for buying drugs, illegally transferring money, or doing illegal shit. So...no...it won't be approved. I am not trying to be a dick or trying to be funny. I am just telling you that this is the CURRENT main use of bitcoin (other than holding or trading as an investment...but is that really a ""use""?).

If the ETF were to be approved then bitcoin would go up a LOT. I am a mediocre mathematician (by trade). My estimate is that bitcoin will quickly go to about $4,000 if the ETF is approved. And yes, it will become a gold rival. But I have no idea how much this will affect the overall gold market since that market is HIGHLY manipulated and is now mostly based on complex derivatives.

The ""underlying asset"" (aka BITCOIN) cannot be traded with a ""high frequency."" That is true. But that just affects its volatility usually. It can still be traded in large quantities, so large orders can go through. And those large orders can go through more quickly if they decide to pay a fee to expedite it. So...I wouldn't worry about any of that. Plus, the exchange spot price is very accurate and the ETF will just mirror this. Basically, if the SEC is not controlled by whomever it is that is keeping a regulatory hand on bitcoin, then it'll be approved. But...it won't be approved, don't worry.

10,"> how can they tie it to transactions based on the price/demand when the underlying asset is so difficult to buy and sell in high frequency 

Here's a general overview ho ETFs work:

https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-etf-files/toy/

So the ETF doesn't have to grow (or shrink) based on demand.   If the BTC/USD exchange rate goes up, investors bid higher for the ETF.     Arbitrage might happen if the ETF gets out of whack with the underlying exchange rate.  If the ETF is more expensive than the underlying Bitcoin, a trader can perform arbitrage without changing exposure to Bitcoin by selling their ETF share (for fiat) and using that to buy the underlying BTC that the ETF share represented. 

This, in theory, should cause the price of the ETF to not differ widely from the value of the underlying asset.

For various reasons the $GBTC ETF trades well above the underlying commodity ... more than 20% currently: http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GBTC/quote 

That's primarily because demand for a Bitcoin ETF is high and $GBTC is not issuing new shares of the $ETF -- thus the only seller are those who previously had acquired shares.

Most ETF managers try to have the share price approximate the value of the underlying commodity.  If there were more Bitcoin ETFs, the premium on this one would likely shrink significantly.

And anyway, as to your concern about the underlying asset ""being difficulty to buy and sell"", there are a number of OTC traders, or Gemini auctions, etc., -- institutions have a number of methods in which they can buy and sell, in additional to the retail exchanges you and I are familiar with.",1,0

IMO China is all that matters when it comes to the bitcoin price.

1,"The thing I would love to see on a map is the flow of BTC from IP to IP.  I realize using IPs for visualizing BTC transactions is imperfect, but it is something that can be done now with publicly available information.

Bitcoin.info has the ""relayed by IP"" listed for each transaction.  On the visualization map, this would be the sender, and the receiver would be the last ""relayed by IP"" associated with the receiving wallet, if there is any such IP.  That is, if the receiving wallet ever made a spend transaction in the past.

Again, this is imperfect because of Tor and because wallets don't have a physical location anyway, but the beauty of such a visualization is to show BTC as a self-contained currency that doesn't need any link to fiat to have value.

3,"In order to explain the blockchain as a ledger, I came up with an analogy related to writing checks, then layered several ideas on top of it.

First, imagine Billy wants to write Jimmy a check for $50 do buy a...Nintendo 2DS. How does Jimmy know for certain that Billy's check won't bounce? That is, before trying to deposit?

What if Billy staples to his check to Jimmy, the previous check, uncashed, that Billy got from Amanda for $75 (And consequently, Billy also writes a check for $25 to himself with the same conditions).

So how do you make sure Amanda's check doesn't bounce? Same rules apply, staple an old check to Amanda's check. And you repeat this thought process over and over until you reach the Mint.

Of course, at some point the binder of checks becomes too big to realistically carry or verify. But what if the whole process was digital? You still have the same security, but without all the dead trees. Enter Bitcoin's Blockchain tech.

See, most banks treat your balance as a transaction sheet as a generic in and generic out, not Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, I'm not just sending you some generic amount of 5 mBTC, I'm sending you, specifically, the 2.5 mBTC I got as change from the coffee shop down the road, plus the 1.5 mBTC that I got as a tip on my Twitch stream using Coinstream,  plus the 1 mBTC that's leftover from the last time I converted from fiat on LocalBitcoins.

I feel like it's sloppy, and could be refined, but that's what I got.

11,"Hey, /u/404llc
I have lot of crtics for you. You need to bare the words here. No other go. You website is not that good enough.

I give a score of only 40 out of 100. Here I will say why? Read all. If you read and comment back on these lines, I would be glad that I did really help a real guy.  

You need SSL Certification
People may find a link route to intrude into exchange sites from where you seek trades. Leads to vulnerabilities.

The design is completely awkward for me. Redesign it.

Select a perfect theme. The social media buttons are located in the places where people won't go for a share.


There are three charts ""Last 24 hours BTC/USD price"". But all three are same. It seems the website is in works.
When I click ""Last 24 hours BTC/USD price"" It is not taking me to bitcoinity.org. Why? Fix it as quick as you can.

The language option button must be place to the top right of the webpage. It is in the wrong place. I first thought it will redefine the chart to a particular language speaking people and show only btc transactions happening there. Change it.


""Why are you waiting for first trade to occur?"" I think unfare for the reason you run this site. Transactions happening round the clock. So change it. Show transactions of all time. Also the wait period for first trade takes around 5 minutes to start. People will leave your site if it is the case. Here you can go for options - All time trade, New trades. This will help.

Fatal error :

When I refresh the page, the page again looks for first trade. This should be fixed. It should not be so. Again go for new trades/all time trades.

Your twitter feeds must be shown on the right side. This is very handy for people to read. Left side attracts less.
The social media icons on the botton of the page is very small and will not be visible to many people. It sucks.

The exchanges you listed to the bottom of the page ""Data from ..."" is completely not visible. You don't need to gray it. You should be proud to list it. Increase the size. It is very small. This applies to next line also. Also ask people to suggest sites and currencies to add. 

If it is opensource developement, then where do you host or update your code. Include github or other similar site where you host your code. That will please people.

The advertisement placements are ok. But it is not visible or don't get you clicks. You need to work on it.

When I click one of the news links, it takes me to a new page and then redirects to the website where the content page is located.

But when it takes to the next page, I see the fiatleak redirect link with some random hash. Instead, you can modify the redirect link with actual news information. If you know wordpress, you can know how can you change this. It is one of the important thing every blog creater uses.

Alternately, you can create a blog.fiatleak subdomain. Curate news content to your blog. Show the startup lines and add ""Read more..."" button and when people click ""Read more..."" redirect them to the concernced website. 

When I click on the exchanges you list, it opens the exchange site on the same tab. Instead code it to open a new tab. 
You have included these exchanges in your calculations. BITSTAMP, BTCChina, BTC-E, Bit2c, Mercado Bitcoin BR, Local Bitcoins, OKCoin, BTCTrade, Huobi China, bitx.co.za, Cavirtex, Bitfinex, Gemini.

I thought when clicking one of the sites, you will be redefining the animations particular to that exchange only. Misleading.

There are lot of excellent themes available on the internet. One of the best one is bootstrap which I admire a lot. Create your website using any of the themes. You first need to try different themes. You can conduct a poll from your supporters to select a good theme. 

I think you're the only one who takes care of back and front end. That's why the designs are not appealing. I don't think this website loads well in mobile phones.

Did you check the loading time of the website? Did you check with different browsers? Do you have the analysis? How much you're comfortable with CSS? 

I think you're using apis of concerned websites to fetch data and do your math. Do you know the api limits of these sites? You need to catch exceptions wherever possible. I think if 100s of viewers online, you may see delays in fetching and displaying. Look into it.


Why you need ""Hide animations?"" button. I don't see a need of this website, if you hide animations. The worst thing is the moment you tick ""Hide animations"" the incoming trades are not shown. I check 2 to 3 times. No trades coming in after I click it. But it is working. It seems you need to ""QC"" with different use cases. Also you need to check for the 1m trade volume. It seems not calculating correctly. Or the animations are not understandable by all.

If you turn off the animation, then you need to add more text to textually visualize the btc-currency pair transaction. Example ""USD to BTC"" ""BTC to CNY"" for every trade that happens. You need also add these to the leftside textbox which displays every trade you track.

Why you need this website? How can it help the new comer to bitcoin? How can people know about fiatleak? Who will introduce fiatleak to new comers? and many questions you need to answer yourself.

There is no coinmarketcap information in any place. 

You need to add options to show/hide sections of the page. User must be able to show/hide twitter feeds, leftside trade display box. News section, that bitcoinity.org chart section. Why the chart is not updating?

Besides, you can include lot of information. This is a very simple one. If you target Adsense you need to work a lot on keywords and techniques to make it search friendly.

How many times in a week, you analyze your traffic? That is needed.

I did a small analysis on the technologies you use in building the website. I have seen nginx and some other good stuff there. But you need a lot of improvement. You have excellent set of tools to help you there. But you're delaying.

Some other tips

1. Don't use iframes. It is not used in these modern days. Not worth to use it.

2. fiatleak.com -watch... heading tag must be smarter than that is now and should be shorter than 80 characters.

3. Meta description should also be rephrased to be smart and simple and easy to understand.

4. Add alt tags to images you include.

5. No social share so far. Don't you even share it in your site. Or my analytics didn't show much.

6. You have very few backlinks. Try to increase it.

7. Keyword usage is very low.

8. You need to add more content pages for your site. There is 0 or no content page available right now for your site. If you add content pages, you can get more keywords and get listed in search engines faster.

9. Page level speed is very poor. You're making as hard as 81 requests to show this page. Work on it. This is not helpful in the long time. You can use bitcoinwisdom.com like sites to fetch trade information by one request instead of sending request to all exchanges.
Alternately, you can make a local database that collects data from all exchanges and use a single query to fetch from there. This increases speed to a great level. 

10. You must be aware of loading javascript at the bottom of the page to speed up the page load.

11. I think you have CSS in a stylesheet. Good. But still you need to work on. Use Minfication techniques if not done.

12. Try to use gzip, Etags. Session cache also helps to retain the animations when people refresh the page.

Okay. My Best Wishes.

12,"To be honest, what most people first ask is ""What will I gain?"" 
I think a vid/ picture depiction of btc's rise in value + the borderless nature of its transactions is what can convince people. 
Being able to send funds anywhere in the world without any form of restriction is a big plus for btc.
Most wont really want to delve into anonymity at first, but the idea of money that can be hidden is appealing.
Also i think the blockchain technology is greatly underlooked. People need to see the potential in a decentralised open ledger system

**First :**

I wish you great success with fiatleak. I believe you have come in a right place for perfect brainstorming.

I already have seen some great suggestions from a lot of people above. 

I don't know much about bitcoin. I'm still a fresh learner everyday. 

However, I asked a question to me ""What should I need from fiatleak if I'm a user, developer, investor, trader, firm?"" and interpreted myself to come with some points.

This is a very short list. I need to say something more if I get enough help.

Excuse me, if I have written something you already have, or suggestions from people posted above and below. 

I might add/edit the post if I strike a new point or express a listed point in more clear way. 

I don't know if my points are worth to read and reward according to your brainstorming needs. However, I expressed myself.

Finally I wish a great prosperous new year wishes. Thanks. Moving into discussions now :

**Basic information**

What should you know? Explain to just a user, a developer, an investor, a company, alien levels.

**Wiki**

Wiki must include basic information about bitcoin. History of bitcoin, recent developments, criticisms, controversies and different testing implementations and the adapted techniques one by one. You can easily link to existing wiki. However, a fiatleak wiki in a much approached way to target the visitor can attract more people and works well overtime. 

You need to update it often as things are changing rapidly. You can also host debates,AMAs and ask people to post their questions, suggestions. You can also try to answer the questions. This will get you return visitors. 

**Honor your visitors**

Illustrations, Wiki are not quite enough. After every page/topic/tutorial/video/illustration/visual/debate/AMA/etc., you can host a quiz and reward people.

You can reward users in different means :

* Award currency - bitcoin, any altcoin, Fiatleak altcoin (if you wish to create).

* Badges - Award bitcoin badges who pass quizzes. As you know, you can fix the level a beginner/expert/developer/pro. You can also let him/her link a fiatleak badge to his/her blog or affix in his/her firm.

* Certification - You can turn into a training institute and start certifying people by treating your quizzes are real tests. You can also earn great reputation in the marketplace. If you're intended to so, this will be a lot of work for you and you need to include programming resources for bitcoin.

* From time to time and on special days/occasions you can host mega contests, get sponsors and award visitors. It can get your site keep visited. I don't intend it for marketing and your growth. You need to do it wisely by not making people mistakenly think about a lottery site. You can award Hardware wallets, Desktops/Laptops, Mining hashes, Free courses, tickets to next to happen tech thans/stalls/etc., 

[Note: You can also get sponsors for quizzes. Let them award people]

**Physical bitcoins** - What is it? Who is making? Can you make one? How it can be traded? + information

**Plus** 

* Videos, pdfs, handouts, Memes, cartoons will help new people who learn things differently.

* Ask visitors **""Can you live with bitcoin?""** Then take them to virtual home/office/marketplace and visually illustrate how can they live with bitcoin. Let them visually and virtually (really also) make purchases, spendings, book orders, reserve suits, lease, start a firm, pay employees, tip people, pay taxes and else in bitcoin. 

* This includes selling for bitcoin, spending for bitcoin, working for bitcoin and many more. You need to brainstorm for a lot of time to get a clear script of what you're going to say here. 

* Virtual tour helps people realize bitcoin usage and a vital addition to fiatleak.

[Note : Source real offers from merchants and let people use in realtime inside visuals. You can also let people use coupons. A great marketplace ahead. Brainstorming will unveil more. I will put a ... here]

* You can try to get great artworks, animations+sounds to show the walk of the life. While illustrating these things, you can include references to live websites, merchants and other setups to make the visitor feel the reality. 

[Note: You can also charge PPM, PPC from them as you're practically advertising while visually preparing newcomers to adapt to bitcoin.]

* You can also ask the people/visitor to post their own views/artworks/visuals/illustrations/blogs that leads to basic understanding, usage and implications of bitcoin at various levels. 

[Note : An SEO healthy link from their own blogs can get you load of visitors daily and make fiatleak one of the imminent website to source information about bitcoin. Long way to go]


**Fiatleak Platform**

**[The fiatleak website/platform must be view complaint on all platforms existing. Desktop, Tabs, Mobiles etc.,]**

Create a fiatleak platform exclusive for your visitors to explore all the possibilities in one screen. 

The platform must be a fully complied great source of information for bitcoiners.

Help people to get tickers, live update links, other stuff that they can stick to their website.

Make fiatleak platform as most advanced information provider in terms bitcoin transactions.

You may include :

>Currency wise transactions

>Country wise transactions

>Minute, hour, day, week, year transactions

>Volume based transactions

>Year, Week, Month, Volume based, Country based, currency based comparisons

>Insustry wise break down analysis of support, adaption, volume, company, freelancers, regulators, taxmen, etc., 

Let users to customize the listings, so that he can visualize according to his/her mind needs. You need to consider a forex professional's point of view.

[Note : Upon success, extend the same to all altcoins that you wish to include]

**Price charts**

I think this is simple. Include price charts similar to trendingview and let people to work on it if they wish to find out trading stuff. This would turn fiatleak into a great platform.

**Calculators/Estimators**

Include calculators. This will help viewers to estimate their profit/loss or make decisions about their next moves. These calculators must also include mining, trading, lending, forex calcs if needed.

Public spending price alerts [I think some users may have suggested it.]

A robust update 24x7 in a page/link that helps users to know about bitcoin support providers in terms of :

>Payment Gateways

>Websites

>Merchants

>ATMs

>Debitcards

>Developers

>Startups

>Freenlance Reources

>etc.,

[Note : I wish to have a detailed customizable list based on countrywise, statewise, popularity, Newly included and many other criteria]

**Regulatory/Banking rules for all countries**

Prepare a great list of information about laws and regulations in each country and add it to fiatleak. Let the users customize and view the regulations and rules they have to follow for their country.

**Tax Implications**

List tax implications for all countries

[Note : Here you can seek country wise law, taxmen to get information to list in the concerned country pages. You can turn into a great law, taxmen board to interact with their country men to deal bitcoins. This will help people who startup a crypto firm, project or wish to do business.

Make it customizable.

Host AMAs, run request campaign for regulators if people need it. Lot can be done. Brainstorm helps.]


**Customizable Richlists**

Let the user set his/her own criteria. Countrywise richlist of bitcoin holders on a particular year, date, month. Currency wise richlist of bitcoin holders + some other criteria. etc., etc., and etc., 


**Fiatleak API**

Help visitors get use of fiatleak platform and other stuff programmatically by creating compelling API that supports integration a variety of levels. This includes simply linking to their blogs/websites, business analytics. 

Help online tutors and presenters to quote live information from fiatleak.

16,"Every day, tens of thousands of potential bitcoin users seek out easy ways to understand bitcoin's utility, adoption and growth.  In the course of researching bitcoin, many of these people end up on FiatLeak.com.

It's human nature to have mental barriers that prevent adoption when we're exposed to new ideas.  I want to contribute by aiding users around those barriers.  I believe, as a community, we need to do our best to greet these new users with visualizations that can be understood globally regardless of education, language or age.  

I'm asking for your help.  I want a brainstorming session in the comments below.  Post your ideas describing new visualizations that can be added to FiatLeak.com along with your bitcoin address.  

The top three ideas, as determined by the community, will each receive 50 mBTC on January 5th.  Please keep the conversation constructive.  I'll also be sending out smaller amounts for interesting comments as gratitude for participating.

I fear you will not end up with more solo miners, but instead the same power house solo miners we already have plus even weaker pool mining, which is already pretty weak. 

I don't think it's a good idea economically. It doesn't address the root cause, which is that you needed to hit a certain scale before you can solo mine effectively",2,0

4,"Good idea. You have everything you need to start your own coin instead of fucking with Bitcoin.

",-2,0
5,"Idea is to reduce competition between large miners and small miners, creating two distinct mining communities, increasing mining decentralization.

1. There are two kinds of blocks. A-blocks and B-blocks. A-blocks are the same as what we have today. B-blocks have a non-outsourcable puzzle like the strategy described in [this paper](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/papers/nonoutsourceable.pdf). B-blocks cannot be pool mined.

2. B-blocks have a new POW. (e.g. SHA-3). This means that hardware for one type of block cannot produce the other type of block.

3. Blocks contain the hash of previous blocks according to this diagram: http://imgur.com/4apq2RC

4. Blocks on each phase can be produced every 10 minutes, resulting in a 5 minute block time overall.

5. Transactions are keyed according to which phase can mine them -- A-blocks can only contain A-transactions and B-blocks can only contain B-transactions. If an output is double spent by two transactions keyed to different phases, and both transactions are mined on consecutive blocks of different phases, then the version of the transaction included in the earlier block is valid and the other one is ignored. Since the mining fee on the second version of the transaction is invalid, miners have an incentive to avoid mining it. Another half-baked idea would be to make the mining fee come from a keyed output, so that the sender must pay a fee if their transaction is included twice...

The core idea I want to express is that all small miners who rely on pools will be forced onto phase A. Phase B will be entirely dominated by large solo miners. This creates an interesting type of diversity among miners based on the scale of the operation, which I have not seen described elsewhere. This could possibly result in small miners not being competed against as fiercely from solo mining operations, meaning the continued existence and significance of smaller miners is more assured. Large solo miners may be more susceptible to political pressure, so we don't want all of the blocks mined by them.

One trader might be responsible for most of the 1,000 bitcoins in one country, while a hundred traders might have been involved in the trading of 100 bitcoin in another country.

6,"The Nigerian Naira depreciated over 40% between June and August of 2016 (link #2).

Google trend data suggests more people are inquiring about Bitcoin in Nigeria right now than the U.S. and Hong Kong combined during the 2013 price peak (link #1). LocalBitcoins indicates a growing number of Bitcoin sellers available to potential local buyers and with a population of 180 million people, over half of which use the internet, Bitcoin could see growing adoption if currency issues remain prevalent in the region. While Gross National Income per capita is low at $2,950USD, limiting the potential for a large influx of capital, Bitcoin adoption driven by human needs rather than an expected ROI is a welcome reinforcement to the cryptocurrency communities larger interests. It remains to be seen if Bitcoin can take hold as an enduring tool for the average Nigerian. 

As a side note I think it's unfortunate we don't have a more in depth perspective from Bitcoin users or new adopters in regions with expanding interests. Polling newcomers in Bitcoin related subreddits regarding their country of origin and the incentives that are driving them to seek out Bitcoin could be really valuable in understanding how Bitcoin as a whole is evolving.

A large bitcoin investor from Shark Tank South Africa says the surge (~December 16th) was a direct response to the interest rate hike and increase of the USD devaluing foreign currencies. There are an estimated four interest rate hikes coming the next year.

Currencies are destabilizing as a direct correlation to political revolutions/globalization. There are elections in 2017 in France and Germany this next year and I personally believe that the value of their currencies in such divisive political times will drop inevitably since one side will be terrified of the outcome no matter the winner.

Venezuela airlines are now only accepting bitcoin. I see this trend growing since they literally weigh their money instead of counting it. 

Donald Trump's immigration policy. Now hear me out on this one. Between deporting criminals and strong border security especially, the traditional method of buying drugs straight from border cartels will become less common/possible. This will cause drug dealers to adapt to changing times, thus switching to dark markets.

> a lot of development is still required in order to deal with the differences in the codebase and in order to add support for many wallets ... all of them need to add a bit of code, it's non trivial, it's a pretty big difference in the codebase ...

That is not true - wallets which know nothing about segwit will be unaffected and will still be able to send to wallets that use it, because the addresses, for now, will just be p2sh ('3') as already understood by every single wallet. For more detail, see the section ""Wallets->Not upgrading"" [here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/27/segwit-upgrade-guide/).


It's hard enough trying to correct the endless torrent of outright lies by antagonists, please make sure you have the basic facts right!

From paying attention to a broad range of ""bitcoin media"" I can tell you that what is needed is not cheerleading Core (that's what you guys tend to lapse towards), but just establishing *basic* facts, like the fact that it **is a blocksize increase** (this needs to be repeated everywhere it's discussed, because believe me, the message is *not* understood - just one example, see the youtube show ""the Filter"" from the bitcoins in bali group, where the speaker on successive shows has presented the ""blocksize debate"" as : (1) increase the blocksize (hard fork but no worries, that's ""clean"", it's ""just one line of code!"") or (2) ""do segwit (which is really complicated!) so we can have lightning""  (tacit assumption blocksize does not increase) - this is the kind of appalling mischaracterisation that has fully embedded itself into the consciousness of the not-really-paying-attention general Bitcoin public).

Forget the crazies and those with an utter lack of humility that are quite sure that (a) Core is evil (despite the fact it's not a thing and doesn't control anyone) and (b)segwit is ""too complicated"" and ""centralizes to give profits to Blockstream"" or some other incoherent drivel; those people are beyond hope.

8,"1. None of us have left Bitcoin when we gain much or get a huge loss.

2. Bitcoin was worth less than a cent and now worth 1000 dollars and above. No one left.

3. Bitcoin is not regulated in most of the places. Everyone wants to hold bitcoin.

4. Many people after a long wait at a price below their desired price. Once they sold it, the price soars to the new level. 99% of the traders/holders here has the same problem.

5. There are plenty of people who started without a cent, has more than $100k in bitcoins. Agree?

6. Mostly people try to hype things in this channel.

7. There are only 21 Million bitcoins. But bitcoins are unlimited and still there are options for all 10 billion whole population to hold bitcoin. that is bitcoin unlimited.

8. Bitcoins creator Satoshi led the space for coders, enthusiasts, noobs, traders to have a new fortune. Evolvement of altnerate platforms like ETH, DASH, MONERO, WAVES are examples.

9. There are huge percent of scammers rather than honest people here.

10. Many people in the crypto space has different faces that are completely hidden and can't be related between faces.

11. Everyday, fresh ideas from fresh talents try to flourish in the bitcoin space.

12. Bitcoin led the way for the importance of lightning network.

13. There are lot of places where bitcoin is trying to penetrate. But in vain due to lot of issues politically, financially and many more.

14. People are really trying to achieve unknown unbelievable ideas. The ratio of achievement and progress is not yet predictable. But the entire community is producing results to some extent.

15. Bitcoin gets more attention nowadays because of the diversely split community supporting various features to improve bitcoin. But, that is also one of the flaws of bitcoin community.

16. Taking bitcoin to every home is impossible for atleast 10 years. Agree?

17. Bitcoin as a mainstream currency as a replacement to paper currency is impossible. Agree? But we as a whole tries to achieve it.

18. /u/changetip's closure has a great impace in social channels. A good alternative is needed now.

19. I don't find a proper place from where I can get legal information about bitcoin laws, taxes and other implications.

20. There is no right compilation of startups based on bitcoin, cryptocurrency, related to cryptocurrencies.

21. Segwit, BU and other terms still confusing to 90% of the community members here.

22. There are lot of talks about faster bitcoin confirmations. Still, it is not achieved.

23. Why bitcoin is always leading against crypto currencies that claim altnerate to bitcoin which has tons of features like anonymity...?

24. Now altcoins price are fixed against btc and then referred to USD. Do you think that any altcoin overtake the prominence and monopoly of bitcoin in the future?

25. Bitcoin vs Humanity. What is your opinion?

26. Bitcoin serves more to gambling rather than gaming industry. Right?

27. Most people who are addicted to gambling that uses bitcoin/altcoin are playing illegally.

28. We are in lack of payment processers/payment gateways for the masses, though there are many available.

29. Many people look for upvotes/promotions/community attention/exposure all over the space by rewarding people in the same thread or from another forum. Right?

30. People always have controversial to each other in r/bitcoin and r/btc channels. Their own standings change often.

There is a lot of support for a small hardfork capacity increase in addition to segwit.

A compromise segwit+2mb proposal was submitted yesterday: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013921.html

We are all aware that segwit is eventually a capacity increase to perhaps 2mb. But it's not the same as a hardfork capacity increase compatible with the current transaction format.

I would also vouch for an additional capacity increase to 2mb on the main chain, so we can relieve the fee pressure, allow smaller outputs to be spent, then scale to 4mb with segwit.

1,"I liked this show.  This was the episode where I [accepted](https://twitter.com/deery_me/status/833567664652111873) my moniker.  

I was a bit surprised myself by Roger's statement while we were recording the episode.  His thinking is far too narrow.  Governments will eventually be competing with each other over control of Bitcoin network policy.  They will defend their interests, violently if necessary. This is where bitcoin is headed if we are successful.

The world is getting fed up with [legacy systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_Electronic_Registration_Systems), and large fractions of the world economies' backend systems will be secured directly or indirectly by Bitcoin [hashpower](https://medium.com/@BrianDeery/hashpower-is-the-ends-bitcoin-is-the-means-4de61c559bc0).  The hashpower is historically what has been touted as giving Bitcoin it's security, as a differentiator from other systems.  The hashpower is a lot of what the world wants.  Most industries will be touched by Bitcoin in one way or another.  It is way more than a payment system, as many on both sides of the argument seem to be limiting Bitcoin to.

With this context in mind, I am disappointed that some core devs seem [blind](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/62k567/nicolas_dorier_core_has_no_center_because/dfob2yb/?context=3) to the fact they are now politicians in one of the branches of Bitcoin governance.  By focusing inward, on technical matters while eschewing concerns of their constituents is poor politics.  The concerns may be baseless, and better solved through existing proposals, but this is a fight over governance, and the battle is being lost.

The miners must not be the ones to dictate which is the default client, as the branches of governance must be separate, otherwise powerful interest groups will weaken the basic tenets of Bitcoin.

At my weekly Bitcoin meetup a few days ago, the tension was palpable.  People are afraid.  This is in contrast to the preceding year, where it has been more of an academic discussion.  The questions and discussion revolved much more about what to expect in a contentious hard fork.  Core developers do not seem to be feeling this tension.

The [hashpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1SHF3YPrjM) is one of the largest factors of what makes Bitcoin valuable.  A change of PoW will be a concession of defeat.  Ethereum's main perceived value is the brains behind the project.  That is why most of the community followed the Foundation down their fork.  The brains behind Bitcoin are most certainly valuable, but the Bitcoin hashpower is comparatively more valuable than the Ethereum hashpower.  The outcome of a contentious Bitcoin fork following the existing devs is not as certain as it was with Ethereum.

I really hope the Core developers realize they are now politicians, and start acting like it.  A compromise would go a long way to easing the tension, even if it makes no sense technically.

0,"The deceased don't pay inheritance tax, their beneficiaries do. So I assume what you're really asking is: 'How can *I* use bitcoin to avoid inheritance tax?' 

As far as avoidance goes (legal attempts to reduce tax exposure) then bitcoin has no advantage over fiat. It's only useful if you wish to evade tax, i.e. illegally.

Although I agree with comments above about taxation as theft it's also important to respect the rule of law so I suggest dropping the idea. Use every legal trick in the book by all means, but don't actually break the law.

For an example, let's say granny buys a load of bitcoin as an 'investment' on the advice of her kindly grandson. Then, sadly, she passes, and it appears she didn't think to include the private keys in her will. The money is presumed lost. However, sneaky grandson has a personal backup of the keys and has full access to the funds.

This is seriously criminal behaviour, you are stealing from the government and also any other potential beneficiaries. I suspect it's jailable should you be caught and any purchased coins would be easily traceable. If they were ever moved it would be immediately obvious someone had the keys. Might you get away with it? Quite possibly, although either you've conspired with other beneficiaries or you've stolen from them too, which makes it more likely you'd get caught.

Tax sucks, it's way too high and we should all campaign towards a smaller state and use every legal means at our disposal to reduce our personal exposure. But don't break the law. It penalises other tax payers and puts you at serious risk.

3,"Stealing is serious criminal behavior. So I advocate that individuals should do everything they can to protect what they have earned. 

For example, let's say some large gang were able to take over a large geographic area containing where your gran happens to reside. 

Well, the gang might think, when that lady dies we'll shake down all of her relatives as they come to mourn her passing. This way, the other wealthy people in their territory won't be as worried.

Well, if gran decided to buy bitcoin off-exchange through Local Bitcoin or even through an exchange but somehow the coins were not recoverable upon her death... well there's nothing anyone could ever do about that.

See gran will need to make a backup of her keys, and its entirely reasonable for her to ask her tech savvy grand kids to help her. It would be their responsibility to make sure proper backups are made - but hey mistakes are made all of the time. But if those kids were lying the gang would consider it a serious insult and they're likely to send thugs armed with guns to punish the grand kids. 

The gang may ask to know things - like the address of the coins. Which they could get if they were able to coerce the exchange where gran bought her coins - but localbitcoins this is not necessarily true. It's also possible that gran is a secretly a techno-savvy cypher punk and as soon as her grand kids aren't looking she launders her coins through Monero and then back to other bitcoin.

21,"Tl;Dr - Just skip to the bottom where I lay out my solar/battery requirements for mining and my solar/battery requirements for vertical farming. Oh...and costs and earnings.

Well, Summer is here and we have had some extremely hot weeks. This has given us a chance to test our greenhouses at temperatures of 126F/52C. We are still up and running quite well. Our energy requirements have gone up quite a bit. But the electricity we are consuming is right in line with our estimates. We do not feel that the temperatures will be any higher than the numbers we have seen so far. Unless Global Warming is for real...because now that I think about it, we did blow through our all-time-high in temperatures...and this was the last day of Spring, if I recall.

We are ordering all of our equipment directly from China. Our 40' greenhouses are extremely cheap to build in China. We are building them for about 40% of what companies like Freight Farms and Bright-Agro-Tech are selling their systems for. Our system is at least 90% as good as their systems. But we do have many bugs, it seems when we first receive them from China. Perhaps my main complaint. They can be a bit finicky. I would not want to sell these as the customer service would consume me.

Our most simple greenhouse uses between 250 and 450 kwh per day. I am in San Diego. Our residential rates from SDG&E are $0.43 per kwh. That is crazy high, for the record. This would cost between about $105 and $190 per DAY. Between about $3,000 and $5,500 per month. Most people in the US pay about $0.11 per kwh. This would equate to a monthly bill of $750 and $1350 per month. The Arizona desert pays that rate, for example.

Next, these greenhouses grow about 4,000 heads of lettuce per month. Wholesale price for this lettuce is $1. We sell direct to the end user. We charge $1.50. But at wholesale prices, this generates $4,000 per month in revenue. Labor is 10 hours per greenhouse. We pay $20 per hour. When you add all the California bullshit taxes and fees for employees this puts us at about $30 per hour. We also have insurance and Workers Comp. This is about $40 per month for each greenhouse.

Ok, now for the solar and battery requirements. We use 150 panels of 300 watt panels. I know...this is a lot. It takes a lot of space. You need a lot of cheap land. We spend about $0.45 per watt for solar panels from China. Our lettuce greenhouses run for 8 hours per day with lights. The other 16 hours we go ""dark"" and do not use much energy (just pumps, air conditioning and a few devices). We run the lights and everything during the peak sun hours. This allows us to not purchase as many batteries because we are turning the sun directly into the farming and lighting. Then, when the sun starts to wane, we turn most systems off and just remain in a well-insulated state. The battery requirements are still large, however. We currently use 50 lead acid batteries for each greenhouse. Each battery is 24V and 200 amp hours. Each battery costs us $180 from China.

Ok, how does this all tie into bitcoin and bitcoin mining? Here's the answer. Each Antminer S9 uses about 1400 watts when it is placed in the environment of our lettuce greenhouse. We place between one and four miners in each greenhouse. We need about 6,000 watts in solar panels to charge up the batteries and simultaneously run one S9 for 24 hours straight. We need 15 of the 24V/200 amp hour batteries for each miner. Cost for panels is $3,000. Batteries are $2750. The miner, when you buy from Bitmain is $1225 delivered to your door in the US. I have over-clocked the miners as high as I am comfy with. I am generating 0.007 btc per miner per day right now. That is about $18 per day at today's rate.

So here is how it all breaks down for the vertical farm: cost for one lettuce farm that is 100% off grid is about $90k. This includes EVERYTHING... solar, batteries, control systems, installation and framing for the solar, greenhouse, all equipment, air conditioners a water cooler...everything. Monthly labor, insurance, nutrients and supplies is $1500. Shipping of the lettuce is about $400. Total net profit is about $2100 per month. And $25,000 per year.

Mining...ok...this is the wobbly one to predict. Just remember this and it'll make it all easier to accept these numbers: bitcoin is probably headed to $10,000 within 3 years. If you don't believe that then much of this will just be comical to you (if it isn't already). One miner will cost (miner + solar panels + batteries + power control systems + cooling equipment and the solar/batteries to support it) = $8000. The solar and battery system costs a total of $6800. The miner is $1200. Once you have purchased the solar and batteries, you own them forever. They can be used to mine for 25 years for solar and at least 6 years with the lead acid batteries. You can amortize these costs.  If bitcoin drops to $0 then you can instantly switch your solar and batteries to your farm. This is how I backstop my potential losses. 

Now, here is the magical way we have figured out how to avoid the ""decay"" that is built into the miners: we run them for 4 to 8 weeks then we sell them on the open market at a premium over cost. When you purchase large numbers from Bitmain, they will offer you a discounted price. The miners seem to always go up in value in between releases fom Bitmain. After 6 to 9 months of reselling at this pace, you will make all of your initial investment back in the miners. You will also stay current with the miners. So, one miner will generate about 2 btc per year (when you stay ahead of decay). That is $5,000 per year at today's rate. If bitcoin follows the trend (and you believe) then I expect that you will generate $6500 or more within one year from mining today. This means the system will completely pay for itself (including solar and batteries) in about one year. Oh...and then after a year, you own a brand new miner (cuz you have been constantly reselling them to stay current and slightly profit). Oh...and you how have 6kw of solar AND batteries...just keep mining til bitcoin is outlawed. You are now in a unique position...your mining rig costs you $0 from this point forward.

I have calculated the amount of profit you can make if you build your own solar/battery array and point this array to different businesses. One business is a modern, vertical farm which is good for the environment and makes healthier food. The other is a bitcoin mining operation. Both businesses have energy as their single largest cost of doing business. I like the idea of having two businesses that I can just point an energy source towards and they start making money. Isn't that kinda cool to think about? Farming generates a net profit of $0.22 per kwh from a solar/battery system. Bitcoin mining generates $0.51 per kwh for the exact same system. Think about that for a minute.

Also, what the fuck? If bitcoin actually does take off, imagine how it will pollute the world with miners in places with shitty but cheap fossil fuel. Shouldn't we be mining on renewable energy since...let's be honest, bitcoin shouldn't really exist? It only exists because people lie a bunch. It seems like protecting ourselves from our despicable selves shouldn't turn the world into a toilet that may become uninhabitable.

I just wanted to share everything with this community. If it weren't for this community, I would have been nervous about trying this crazy idea. What I mean by this is that I appreciate the handful of people here who have a lot of bitcoin and just handed them over to me so that I could test this TOTALLY insane and HIGHLY SPECULATIVE business model. I told you (those who lost their btc to me) that I will make it up to you. For the couple of you who didn't threaten to kill me, I will return your btc when my profits from mining hit 4,000 btc, unless the price is under $3100 per btc...seems fair...you did lose...and it was a fair bet.

I hope for several things from this post. (1) The nice people who are here hopefully will take this info and appreciate what went into getting these numbers. (2) Someone will read this, run the numbers themselves and decide to do the exact same thing. (3) Someone in an area with good sun, year round, will set up a mining operation based on my model. (4) Someone will bet me publicly again that I am lying. (5) Someone interesting will buy the land next to mine and compete head-to-head with me...I seem to perform better under competition.

To;Dr - To take a miner off grid, in a sunny place, will cost $8,000 (including the miner). You'll break even in a year if you follow my plan (and if fate complies as well). One 40' greenhouse that is off grid costs me $90k. Least amount of net profit per greenhouse is $25,000 per year. Average net profit is $36,000per year, typically from blending lettuce and other crops such as basil.

Farming generates a net profit of $0.22 per kwh from a solar/battery system. Bitcoin mining generates $0.51 per kwh for the exact same system. Think about that for a minute. We sell energy back to the grid for about $0.05. Does anyone look at this the way I am looking at it?...I am just curious.

Anybody have any questions?",162,1

Cash is required for the transport system here. Unfortunately my debit card was eaten by the ATM the other day so I have to take cash out via a credit card. This is very expensive. Cash is so common here I'm having to pay through the nose while a new card arrives. I have to pay fees also for the debit card on cash anyway.

2) In the population of 7 million here there is _1_ person selling cash in exchange for Bitcoin on Local Trader. That person is not replying to messages. 

3) Local Bitcoins has a few traders but all except one are wanting bank transfers. Banks will not take a customer here without a local ID card.

* For a hard fork in Bitcoin to succeed, **there needs to be near unanimous support from the entire Bitcoin ecosystem**, which generally includes the following constituent groups: node operators, users, core developers, wallets, exchanges, and miners.  Right now it's very clear that there is a large contingent of users, developers, wallets, and exchanges that have not signed on to this hardfork, so unanimous support is lacking.
* Even minor changes in Bitcoin (let alone critical consensus changes) have taken generally many months or years of review and testing by the best experts to ensure the code is safe and bug-free.  **The timeline for Segwit2X does not allow for the kind of testing and review needed**.
* The hard fork doesn't address the many concerns over the years that have been brought up about the negative impact of increased load, cost externalities, miner and node centralization, and potential consensus failures
* The timeline for the Segwit2X hardfork is such that there is no way for all the major groups to upgrade in time.  As [Greg Maxwell said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6h612o/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_core_wont_endorse/divtc93/): 

> ""Its time-frame is extremely absurd. Actually, absurd doesn't do it justice which is why between that and number #1 several engineers have been just responding ""LOL"" to the proposal. They don't set any time for design review and analysis, they don't set any time for writing a specification (they don't have one and don't appear to intend to have one), they set aside two weeks for testing-- which is less time than even minor releases of Bitcoin get (and need!) even when they were comprised of small fixes which had mostly existed for months already. They don't allot any time for alternative implementations to implement it (which is especially bad because they can provide useful design feedback). They don't set aside time for meaningful deployment by users (some of whom may have their own lengthy patching and qualification process). They don't seem to have any concern about how forced upgrades erode decentralization and privileged hosted wallets/apis/pools over running your own infrastructure. Basically every stage of the consensus rule change pipeline should take (and always has taken) more time they allotted for everything. BU+Classic BIP109 ran on testnet for months before their interoperability failure was revealed and they forked apart from each other and abandon BIP109.""


Now, let's assume for a moment that 80% of the hash power runs this fork as well as some of the economic ecosystem that signed the New York agreement like Abra, Bitpay, Coinbase, Blockchain, Purse, Shapeshift, Xapo, etc.  What would happen?  First, a large number of users and other parts of the ecosystem might not support it.  There are many economic parties that were not part of the agreement, such as wallets like Trezor, MyCellium, Armory, Bitcoin Wallet (Android), Green Address, Breadwallet, Electrum, etc.  There were a lot of exchanges that weren't part of the agreement, like Kraken, Poloniex, Bitstamp, Gemini, Bithumb, Bitfinex.  

What if several of those mentioned major economic players decide not to support Segwit2X and don't run the Segwit2X/btc1/NY client?  I believe what would happen in that scenario is the following:

* **Bitcoin will permanently hard fork into two chains** (note, this is not the oft-discussed chain split that could happen with BIP-148).  If the companies switching to the new chain insist on trying to call it ""Bitcoin"" instead of something else like ""Bitcoin2X"" then it would probably cause massive confusion in the ecosystem because everyone else still on the original chain would still call that chain ""Bitcoin"".
* Since the vast majority of core developers don't support this proposal, I believe after some possible period of confusion, eventually **everyone would converge back to calling the original chain Bitcoin since it's the chain that is supported by the Bitcoin Core ""reference client"" that is trusted by the majority of users today**.  The companies that signed the New York agreement would probably be forced to abandon trying to calling the new chain ""Bitcoin"" due to the confusion that would cause.  They would have to call the new chain something else like ""Bitcoin2X"".
* If there were two chains, many of the exchanges that were not party to the New York agreement, such as Kraken, Poloniex, Bitstamp, Gemini, Bithumb, Bitfinex, etc. just to name a few would probably list both coins at the least, or possibly just the original chain only.  That would also put pressure on the exchanges that signed the New York agreement to still provide users access to their coins on the original chain if there was a market for the original chain coins because to do otherwise could be seen by the users as a loss of economic value that they should be entitled to.  After the Ethereum hard fork, a few hosted wallet companies tried to ignore the fact that their users were entitled to coins from the original chain, but were eventually [forced to concede and give their users access to the coins](http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-enable-withdrawals-ethereum-classic/) on the original chain.
* Finally, I am speculating here, but I believe with both coins listed on various exchanges, **users would by a large majority choose to buy the original coin supported by the Bitcoin Core client**, NOT the coin supported by the Segwit2X/btc1/NY client.  Further, they would probably sell the Segwit2X/btc1/NY coins for core coins, forcing their price of Segwit2X/btc1/NY coins down significantly.  If the price of the original coin is higher and the Segwit2X/btc1/NY coin is lower, there would then be an enormous incentive for miners to abandon the new Segwit2X/btc1/NY fork and return to mining the original fork.  Even if the 80% of the mining hashpower that signed the New York agreement agreed to mine on the new chain, how long would they keep that up when they see they could make more money by switching back to the original Bitcoin chain being supported by higher prices and buy orders?  I posit that **so long as the users financially support the original chain supported by Bitcoin Core, the vast majority of miners will act in their own self interest and abandon the new Segwit2X/btc1/NY chain because it won't be as economically feasible to mine.**  Eventually, given that most developers won't support the Segwit2X/btc1/NY client, the coin will lose interest and possibly die off or remain a minor altcoin.

An important point to keep in mind is that nearly every core developer has at one point in time supported the idea of a hard fork and even larger blocks.  But what they *haven't* supported is doing it without a high degree of consensus on forking safely, without the best research, lots of testing, and a very long time horizon.  

If we truly want to hard fork Bitcoin, we need to do it wisely, following the very challenging but necessary process for making such critical consensus changes.  And it needs to be done with an open community process, not with a New York style agreement that leaves out major parts of the ecosystem.  Bitcoin core is not the enemy of hardforks, or even block size increases.  But **there has to be very good justification for making these changes, a high degree of consensus and buy-in from the whole ecosystem, lots of research, good code, lots of testing, and a compelling need.  It's a high bar, but not impossible**.  While there exists methods of getting more scale with safer methods (Schnorr signatures, bi-directional payment channels, transaction cut-through, extension blocks, lightning, flex caps, drivechains, etc.) hard forks seem less compelling for the moment.",11,1

Coinbase use to pay the transaction fee for transferring bitcoin out of your Coinbase account, they no longer do that. Now, you have to pay the fee, and I believe they control what the fee is (It's been a long time since I transferred bitcoin out of Coinbase so I'm not sure of their protocol at the moment).

So, if you have 0.008 bitcoin in your wallet, and you want to transfer out 0.008 bitcoin, that leaves zero bitcoin left over to pay the miner's fee.

What you need to do is buy more bitcoin! Buy another $25, $50, $100, worth of bitcoin from Coinbase. Download and install **your own wallet on your own computer or phone**! Your Coinbase wallet should only be used to buy/sell bitcoin, not to hold bitcoin or make purchases. Use you own wallet to hold and spend, hold your own keys! If you don't hold the keys, you don't really own the bitcoin!

If you're installing a wallet on your computer, I recommend Electrum. **Very** flexible when it comes to the user picking the transaction fee.

If you're installing a wallet on your cell phone, I recommend Mycelium. **Somewhat** flexible when it comes to the user picking the transaction fee.

Now that you have your own wallet installed **and backed up**, transfer all bitcoins out of Coinbase into your wallet.

* On your computer wallet, go to the ""receive"" tab and click the ""copy address"" button. Then go to your Coinbase account and click ""send"". Paste the address into the send field. Then click ""use max"" to send the maximum amount after fees. And click ""send funds"" to send. Now you have all your bitcoins on your own wallet where you control the keys and the transaction fees.
* If you installed Mycelium on your phone, there's a little different process. You need to get a Mycelium address on your phone to your computer so you can paste it into the Coinbase webpage. Bring up your Mycelium wallet. Tap ""receive"". Tap ""copy to clipboard"". Go to texting and tap whatever icon you have to start a new text. For the receiving phone number, input your email address (**Yes, you can send a text to an email address.** Or if you have emailing on your phone past the address into a email and send it to yourself.) Now ""tap and hold"" where you would normally type a text until the word ""paste"" pops up. Let go, then tap ""paste"". Then tap ""send"". Now go to your email on your computer. You should have an email with the Mycelium address in it. Highlight the address and right-click the mouse and select ""copy"". Now go to your Coinbase account and follow the directions above (from the computer wallet section) to send the Coinbase bitcoins to your phone's Mycelium wallet.

And that's it. Now you have your own bitcoins, in your own wallet, holding your own keys, with a lot more control of the miner's fee.

* I only accept theymos-coins in payment for goods/services.
* If I trust someone to provide value for their coins, then I can trade my theymos-coins for their coins at some exchange rate depending on how I perceive the relative difference in usefulness of the coins, and with a limit depending on my degree of trust in that person.
* If I want to pay some online shop who's never heard of me, it's done by routing through the trust network. Example: Bob deals with me from time and considers my coins to have value, so he's willing to trade 1 theymos-coin for 1 Bob-coin. Bob works for the online store, so the store will trade 1 Bob-coin for 20 Store-coins.

It's kind of a weird system to think about, and difficult to bootstrap, but if you got a whole community/city/country/world to use it, I think that it would work very well. It's even more decentralized than Bitcoin in some ways, and more scalable, though it's probably much worse as a store of value.

(You may notice that this similar to how Lightning is intended to work, though the idea predates Lightning by a very long time.)

If you're not allowed to use any cryptography at all, this system would I think still be possible, but it'd be a lot more time-consuming because you'd have to do a lot of face-to-face interactions.

Thank you for reaching out!

BitPay observes the proof-of-work based consensus rules of Bitcoin and will follow the consensus changes that miners enact as long as we do not view those changes to be harmful to our users (in which case we would likely evaluate a potential transition to an alternative fork of Bitcoin in concert with others in the community).

Regarding the proposed segwit changes specifically, BitPay fully supports it and is working with miners to encourage activation as soon as possible.

Regarding BIP-148, we are not signaling or running it as it would put our users at risk.

One of the things that btc won't tell you is that many of its members, perhaps mods even are involved in the practices of scatology. This is a method by which you throw feces at a wall and interpret the patterns to divine the future, as well as for sexual gratification. 

My memory of the party is hazy but I do remember that at one point in the dim red light that Roger  Ver himself appeared in front of me after the events were already underway--attendees were giving each other enemas, splattering poop and poop-water all over the floor--and touched me on the shoulder. He said to me, ""mattisb, let me tell you of our plans to ruin bitcoin. But first, let us poop in each other's mouths."" He then squatted down and squeezed out a nasty poop, right into Dr. Craig S. Wright's eagerly awaiting mouth.

11,"I have no idea if the following is true, but it is a plausible theory in my view (and a reason to sell BCH before it crashes):

The spam attacks which were the only reason the blocks were full were expensive for whoever was behind them, but that party had a plan - pump altcoins and fork/take over bitcoin.  

The altcoin pump was very effective.  When miners began to signal for Bitcoin Unlimited instead of segwit, bitcoin's ""dominance"" (its share of the total crypto market cap) fell from 85% to 50%.  

Part two of the plan went sideways when Bitcoin Unlimited proved unviable and the UASF movement demonstrated that SegWit would not be blocked.  

Whoever it was behind this attack then desperately pulled off the BCH fork on the day that the UASF was due to activate - thereby creating further confusion and adding to the altcoin pump.  

Greed and powerlust had those parties propping up the price of BCH with their gains from the altcoin pump, but they have spent themselves out and the price is slowly sliding relative to BTC. 

As the chain is practically abandoned (virtually no transactions) and miners keep leaving it due to the low price, there is no stability in its block discovery time and it is clearly becoming an abandoned shitcoin but with an absolutely stratospheric market cap.  A 90% decline relative to bitcoin is entirely possible over several crashes.  There are no fundamentals indicating it should increase in value relative to any of the top 10 coins in fact (and some of them are pure shit too).  

So sell that shit while there are still some funds supporting its value.

9,"Here's broadly how Segwit2X came about, since so many are asking (if I mangled or missed something it's okay, my post is secured by proof-of-pedantry and you can find the proper info in the comments):

Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit).

This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.

He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself).

The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.

Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners).

Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.

With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named ""UASF"" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with ""Segwit2X"", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.

The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit.

To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:

Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.

All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.",112,1

Result: if either side is right, bitcoin in one form or another lives on. If the reality, no matter what outcome anyone wants, is anything in between, it will be a big mess.

>I'm also trying to understand why 0-1mb increases in Bitcoin size was fine but 1mb+ is seen as unnecessary centralisation?

It isn't the increase in blocksize that people here are objecting with. I think you'll find the vast majority agree that at some point a block size increase will become necessary. I think that main issue many are objecting to is the back room nature of the deal made out of the light of public view, and the rushed, sloppy nature of the code being pushed out. It is tremendously immature and capricious to throw this huge change to bitcoin out so fast and without rigorous testing and criticism. Contentious hard forks MUST be avoided at all costs. 

Not only does this particular hard fork NOT try to avoid it, it actually *rushes* it out by means of a tiny, tiny dev team bereft of community and expert critic and review, and is funded by a cartel of Chinese miners and big companies with interest in co opting bitcoin to their corporate purpose.

3. Antminers have a [kill switch](http://www.antbleed.com). Get another brand or make sure to disable the kill switch.

4. You will have to find a mining pool that stays with Bitcoin, or mine solo which might not be profitable

5. During the chaotic first few weeks after the attack, mining for Bitcoin might be very profitable, but maybe not. Core could also decide to change to PoS to save bitcoin, which would force you to mine for sw2x to recover your investment. If things go well and Bitcoin survives and thrives, eventually the margin for miners will again depend on the cost of electricity in your area.",1,0

6,"Straightforward question really -- would it make sense for people who can afford it to invest in miners for the November fork, so we can try to offset some of the lost hashpower when some unknown portion of the miners switch?

It may even be an opportunity to get into the game, seeing as a big ""slot"" is being left open. Basically, if 90% of the miners leave, the probability that your miner or mining pool will find a block becomes 10x what it is today (regardless of difficulty target).

1,"This is or isn't about the size of the block or the LN. A larger block mean Bitcoin is more difficult to mine which is an advantage for Chinese miners. Larger blocksize centralizes the hashrate even more than it is now.

The more centralized the hashrate the further Bitcoin falls from Satoshi's original purpose of Bitcoin - A decentralized peer to peer exchange of currency.",1,0
2,The 2x chain will also have the LN option. So what is your point?,0,0
3,"Most have heard the rules. The longest valid chain with the most proof of work is Bitcoin. Or as some say the most proof of work. Or is it the chain with the most nodes. It's all confusing. But I'll explain from a human aspect on how we judge things. 

1. Bitcoin has evolved from a small tiny niche protocol. Along the way it has had many downfalls and many surprises. It never gives up. Hence the honey badger. But what gives it this characteristic. It's the drive and motivation of the people. Unbreakable spirits united to make it the best. 

2. Till the day arrived where more people joined. They want to join in making money too. As Bitcoin grows so does its complexities. People are very complex. But it's a gold rush. 

3. For years the debate of how to scale was an unforgiving battle. It's a mix of hardware, software, businesses, and investors. Each want has its own way of saying this is what we should do. In the beginning this was relied upon Core. They write the code that mostly everyone uses. Then other devs came in and created competition. But for the most part 90% of the community runs cores code. 

4. This brings us here today. A competing implement has arrived that has miner support and some business support. This is not to be taken lightly. The dev is addressing a need of the community under what the miners have demanded for 2 years. Core delivered Segwit. 

5. But none of this matters after Segwit is on the chain. Any blocksize increase doesn't matter. Segwit enables easier off chain scaling. It's called LN. Now the main chain companies that have sided with the miners must now realize this. You ran out of time to 2X. The battle to wrestle the code for your benefit is passed. Plus by holding the protocol hostage to demand a blocksize increase spoiled the milk. Users are not on your side. Throw as much money and salt as you want. Users will migrate to the path that leads to LN. 

6. November will come and the chains will split. The 1X chain will prevail. Why? Because LN devs work with Core on technical issues. They are creating a complement layer on top of the chain you so want to rule. These devs do not have to follow the longest chain or the most worked chain. Nothing binds them to Satoshi consensus. 

7. What will users do. They will migrate to wallets that allow them to have segwit transactions first. They will wait till LN apps become available to use. Then they will migrate off chain.  At this point Satoshi consensus means very little. It's all about LN. The chain with LN wins. And 2X while you patronized with the miners. Core saw the future. It's not on chain. 

8. So those who are so obligated to this New York agreement stay that way. Divorces are messy. But the kids will stay with whomever has LN. Good luck competing. 2X will never beat 1000 plus transactions per second. This is not personal. It's the reality. 

9. Investors and users here is my advice from experience. Those who fail to embrace the future are the past. Don't put your money into the fastest horse when cars are being built. Know that over time everyone will have a car. The infrastructure will be built to scale the more demand that is needed. ",6,1

1,"If Bitmain and all the other Bcash supporters stop mining Bitcoin and choose one of the btc-forked altcoins, there are most likely a lot more persons interested in Bitcoin as the real game-changing project in fields of currency, cryptography, decentralization, (soon) anonymity & privacy and of course many new upcoming innovations we never will see in any of the other Bitcoin clones.

That alone will make more regular users interested in beginning mining at home with either some already owned hardware miners or just plenty of fast GPU's.

My guess is then that it wont take long before the first kickstarter projects emerge with the goal of creating a new range of miner hardware that is more effective at less power (since green energy is important apparently) and aiming to get the price down to a level where everybody can participate.

Also the mining software itself should be a whole new area to begin updating by building from scratch, and try to take better advantage of the hardware its running on.
Who knows, maybe someone can figure out a proper way to build a JavaScript miner to replace adds, that actually can make a contribution to the hashpower without overloading the visitors browser or CPU, now that assembler is on its way into new browser. (however I still have my doubts about browser bitcoin mining, but we never know..)

Its should have started sooner already, but Bitcoin and blockchain technology is still a difficult area that takes a tremendous effort to learn. But more and more books, guides and teaching classes are becoming available so it will slowly become easier, and then it will add a lot of new people to the scene with hopefully fresh new ideas for optimization, technology, anything new...

All I did was download bread & set up my wallet.

Then, I went to the receive money screen on bread

& then on coinbase, i clicked the accounts tab and then the account that had my funds.  I clicked the send arrow

Up popped the place to enter the address.  I copied the ""receive money"" address from my bread and sent it via whatsapp to myself (another whatsapp account - but you could email it) and then copied and pasted the address to the coinbase page and hit send.

It asked for my 2FA (Google Auth) - I put it in and it was on its way.

A few seconds later, my bread notified me of an incoming transfer.  I watched both (bread on my phone and coinbase on my computer) as they ticked off 1 - 6 confirmations, about every 10 mins, and after about an hour, the transfer was complete.

In the future, if you want to buy more coin, you can buy it at coinbase or any other exchange, or anywhere else you can accumulate it) and then just send it to your wallet.  If you ever want to sell it at coinbase, just reverse the process and send it back to convert to dollars/euros, etc.

71,"silly question.  Bitcoin gets mined in coins, but can be traded / exchanged in fractional coins all the way down to Satoshi.  Does the block chain have to keep track of every individual satoshi and the associated address, that seem silly slow and wasteful.  So how does blockchain deal with coin unit fragmentation?  My balance could have originated from multiple sources, but when I transfer it all to one address, presumably the part bits have to be transferred rather than a single unit of whatever size.  Given there is full audit tracability in the blockchain of which addresses any part of a coin got transferred through then that argues the fragments have to be tracked.  If that is true.. then while Bitcoin is relatively unpopular / low value the fragments will be larger but if Bitsoin displaces FIAT which will also likely mean the value rapidly grows then transactions will be in ever smaller fractions of a coin and conceivable the whole block of issued coins gets increasingly fragmented into smaller and smaller chunks.  It seem like this would result in transactions becoming increasingly onerous to process / track and the size of the block chain transaction history...

That is NOT what the irs guidance says no matter how many random strangers on the internet throw that out there.
 
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf

And its also NOT what actually happened.

Show me where in the tax code or guidance it says that if you trade one denomination of ""virtual currency"" (the IRS's specific category with its own IRS definition)  for another denomination of  ""virtual currency"" it is a stated taxable event. I will show you several instances in statements and settlements with the IRS and senate that specifically DONT say that and in fact seem to indicate the OPPOSITE.

I beleive the irs and congress intended to exclude the trading of virtual currencies from a taxable event so as not to destroy the important growing industry. I beleive they rightly beleive that having ten ethereum and one bitcoin is very similiar to having a ten dollar bill vs having ten 1 dollar bills and remember swapping those is NOT a taxable event. I beleive that is wise of congress becuase this is all evolving and no one knows what virtual currency differences do and will mean in the long run and theydont want to screw this up.

And the wording of the IRS and The senate oversight committee press releases and the coinbase settlement all seem to indicate i am right and they exclude swapping one virtual currency denomination for another as a stated taxable event. We must assume if they wanted to say it was they would have specifically said it was.

Remember the Irs does treat "" virtual currency"" differently. ""virtual currency"" is literally the irs new definition and hasnt ever existed before and is recognized as differen than anything else. . Its not the same as stocks or gold. They create whole new guidance for ""virtual currency"" becuase they recognized it has unique characteristics.

And if you trade say bitcoin for ethereum on say poloniex you NEVER cashed to fiat because poloniex specifically doesnt allow that...probably SPECIFICALLY NOT to trigger IRS fiat capital gains reporitng requirements because poloniex is a US registered financial institution and know the trouble points afterprobably having extensive discussions with their lawyers because they are a New York registed company.

Remember while the irs guidance says if you trade virtual curency for OTHER PROPERTY or for a SERVICE or if you are PAID in virtual currency  for your services then you owe capital gains or personal income tax as properly calculated.

However in all those statements in the guidance vand senate press release and coinbase settlement) it specifically DOES NOT SAY if you trade VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY it is a taxable event.   

They specifically listed all the OTHER things as taxable events. Since they didnt list virtual currnecy traded for virtual currency  that then we get to assume they DIDNT MEAN IT WAS A TAXABLE EVENT.

You dont get to say ""oh thats what they MEANT to say""

No. If they mean  to say it we get to assume they WOULD HAVE SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WHICH THEY DIDNT.

Again look at the entirety of the guidance   https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf


So you have to back up something when you go beyond guidance and beyond law and create your own rule.

Thanks.

I'm Not being a jerk.

I just need to see the law or guidance you are quoting for your source.

Remember the IRS guindance says only that ""virtual currency"" is a single category of property. It does NOT say different virtual currencies are different properties or types of properties. That is NOT  distinction the IRS has made. 

It does NOT distishguish between different virtual currencies as DIFFERENT  property. So far there is no ruling that says that (that I am aware of.)  

As far as the IRS is concerned they could be thinking that switching from one virtual currency to another is not selling anything. To them it could be like painting your boat a different color. In fact I wouod argue it IS just like painting your boat a different color EVEN if painting it makes it worth more or less value. Its still the same property.  Remember virtual currency is not divisble physical things. Thats why the IRS had to write special guidance in the first place.

Also remember you need to follow guidance and law as written. If it doenst say it you dont assume they meant to say it. You dont make up your own added language.

You file and pay based on actual written law and guidance.

The guidance does NOT say trading only virtual currency is the same as selling and buying other property or even trading other property.


The IRS  DOES saying selling virtual currency for fiat IS a taxable event though.

If the IRS WANTED  to say trading one virtual currency for another is taxable they would have actually said that in the next sentence. They didnt. You dont get to add a missing sentence they didnt write.


*********For further evidencesee tue senate committee notice after the irs guidance was issued.

Notice what they say is taxable and notice they do NOT list ""trading virtual cureency""   as taxable  http://www.nasact.org/files/Federal_Relations/Washington_Update/2014_03_31_Washington_Update.pdf

Hell they specifically say it has some characteristics of currency as legal tender but theydont recognize say bitcoin as different than ethereum any more than they say 10 dollars as ten 1 dollar bills is different than a ten dollar bill and call for taxing that swap.

*******As further evidence  swapping different virtual cureencies has not been ruked taxable i give you Coinbase's settlement with the IRS who wanted Coinbase to give them all usrrs names and coinbase protested saying irs rukes dont apply to their customers and HERE IS WHATTHEY SETTLED ON.

reporting ONLY pekple who received at least $20,000 in CASH for virtual cureency

Quote

>Will Coinbase send me a 1099 or similar form?

>For U.S. users only, Coinbase provides Forms 1099-K to certain business users and GDAX users that have received at least $20,000 cash for sales of cryptocurrency related to at least 200 transactions in a calendar year.

NOT people who traded virtual currencies for other virtual currencies no matter how much they traded. NOT users who withdrew virtual currencies.

Thats a very important point.

And remember that was after coinbase and the IRS had some intense negotiation and thatis whatthey both agreed was relevant for the IRS. So that has meaning.


I suggest that the proper wayto think about how the IRS thinks about virtual currency is that swapping some ethereum for some bitcoin etc is like swapping a ten dollar bill for ten one dollar bills and is not a taxable event. I feel that way becuase all the guidance and senate ststements and their settlement with coinbase all seem to indicate that and excludes swapping  name of virtual cureency for another denomination of virtual currency.  

Of course tommorrow they might change their mind and issue new guidance and the congress who actually makes the laws might agree or disagree. Only congress makes the law on this no matter whattue guidance.


But i dont think it is congresses intent to stifle trading cryptocurrencies with taxes now. I think they want to minimize thst. I think they arecorrect and ots the coreect way to look atit and all the written guidance so far and the coinbasesettlement seems to not contradict me.


(i am not an attoney or tax professional. This is my personal opinion. Many people over pay their taxesevery year. Correctly and legally avoiding taxation that doesnt exist is not illegal and is not evasion. Pay your correct taxes. Dont lie and conceal. This is all a new world. Many rules arent written yet. But never does the court or congress require or intend to require anyone to pay a tax on something that the congress has not said they must pay a tax on)

What does all this mean? it means i am personally comfortable defending in an audit the position that trading different names of virtual currency is NOT a taxable event and I feel comfortable pointing out the evidence in the IRS guidance and senate statements and Coinbase settlement thatdefend tuat position. Of course the IRS could say i misinterpreted and might even fine me a penaltly for late payment of something if they thought i was wrong. (its rare they give you a penatly if there was an honest legitimate different interpretation of unclear matters. )  But that isnt criminal and no different than any other tax filling and certainly better than paying taxes you dont actually owe.  and I am not a tax protest nor would i hide anything or misrepresent anything to the IRS. And I am NOT saying anyone else should.  But nothing i have seen in guidance or senate statements or the coinbase settlement on reporting gives me any reason to think that trading virtual currency denominations is a reportable or taxable event. In fact it all points to the opposite conclusion.


Someone show me a better argument?

Now maybe tomorrow they will all send out different guidiance or have a different court ruling or law from congress but we dont pay taxes for taxes that dont exist yet but one day might exist in the future.",40,0

If you bought one crypto solely for the purpose of buying another crypto - so there was no profit/loss made because after you bought the one crypto you traded it for another crypto....

One comment on crypto-for-crypto... What you say is certainly true in the new tax bill, for 2018, not sure about 2017. Reason is the like-for-like trade, which applies to *property* now, but only *real property* from 2018. In other words, I think one can claim like-for-like exemption for crypto-to-crypto trades. Of course, if you sell for fiat, no go.

Side note: The like-for-like exclusion can be seriously annoying. Say you trade BTC @ $10k for LTC @ 0.02BTC. You end buying BTC again at 0.01, so you only get back half of your BTC. Meanwhile, 1BTC goes to $30k... you stiil ""made $5k"" and need to pay taxes on it. FFS, **I LOST 0.5 BTC!!!** lol. Oh well.",9,0

62,"So you Invested in some Bitcoin this year and made some sweet, sweet Fiat? Maybe you traded your Bitcoin, to Etherium. Then maybe you traded your Etherium for some Bitcoin and some Ripple. What are you taxed on? I hope to answer these questions.

**Selling for Fiat**

So the first way that you'll owe GAINS TAX is if you sold bitcoin for money, at a profit! It does NOT matter when you bought the Crypto. It only matters that you sold it in the last year. So if you bought a bitcoin 1 month ago for 8k. And sold today at 13k. You NEED to report a $5,000 on your taxable gains. 

**Trading for Other Crypto**

The other scenerio when you need to report is when you trade for other other currencies. When a trade commences it is treated as you selling and then buying whatever your trading for. So if you bought bitcoin 1 month ago at 8k. And traded it to BCash today while bitcoin was 13k. It is treated that you sold the bitcoin at that price and you need to report the 5k.

This might sound unfair, however the same method is used for trading rare materials (Gold, Silver), Stocks, other fiat currencies, and any other property type investments.

**Multiple Buys and Sells** ^or ^trades...

Note: If you bought Bitcoin at $8k, Sold at 13K Bought at $19k, Sold at $12K... You made $5k, then Lost $7k. So your capital gains is -$2k. You pay the total of all your transactions.

**Short Term** Vs **Long Term**

This is short, but if you sold (or traded) crypto-currencies that you've hedl for over 1 year that is considered a Long Term Investment. If it comes out as a negative you can carry those loses for 7 years. You can not carry loses from short term investments (Bought and sold(traded) in less than 365 days). 

So if you bought bitcoin 2 years ago for $20,000 (You got scammed?) and sold last month for $8k, you have a long term lose of $12,000. This $12,000 lose can be added to your income next year so your gains are less. (They carry over for 7 years).

**Mining**

For miners, Mining income is treated as self-employed income, NOT capital gains tax. When a coin is mined you report the income from the worth of the coin from when it was mined. So if you mined 1 btc (Good job...) 1 month ago at $8k. You'll report $8k under self-employed income. Say you sold that bitcoin you mined last month today for 13k. You will need to report both the 8k income, and the 5k capital gains. (These are taxed at different rates depending on your income...) Expenses are not included in the cost bases. So you WON'T subtract $100 from the 8k. However you can add any expense at the end of the year if you operate your mining operations like a LLC or somthing!

**Final Thoughts**

From my research (Professional accountant, amateur crypto-dude) these are the cases of taxable transactions. If you want Crypto-currency to be taken seriously, you need to treat it like a serious currency, which is taxable. There are ways to reduce your taxes, but I'm not going to outline them, since some of them are grey areas. Also, if you haven't been actively trying to reduce taxes until now... It's too late for 2017. 

Be smart. Hire a professional to assist you if you've made massive gains. It's better to pay a tax professional .05 btc than to lose all your bitcoin because you technically laundered money because of your ignorance. (That doesn't hold up in court).

**Disclaimer**

I'm just some guy typing this at my in-laws house over holiday break. Gone half crazy after spending time with them. While I am a professional accountant, I'm also a random redditor on the internet. Do your own research, or hire someone to do all this for you. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE! ^(Hopefully ^that ^gets ^the ^SEC ^and ^IRS ^off ^my ^back...)

Edit: Missed one... 

**Making a Purchase**

When you buy something! Oh boy! So you treat this as gains from the purchase price of your coin to the sell price of your coin. So if you bought 1 btc for $8k. And you bought a new car for $8k today when BTC was worth $13k. You would pay the gains tax on what you ""Sold"" to buy that car. This gets complicated so I'll try to format it the best I can...

You sold $8,000 worth of the bitcoin that is worth 13K. So 8/13 or .615%. Without going into FIFO or FILO options... We'll consider FIFO (Don't worry about terminology, just giving it incase YOU want to go look it up!)

You'll need to take .615% of your original investment to get your cost basis. $8k * .615 = $4,920.

$4,920 is the amount you'll consider that is your original investment, and you sold for 8k. So your capital gains is $8k - 4,920 = $3,080 <---- This is your taxable gains. THIS IS A TAXABLE EVENT! In regards to transaction fees... Technically The fee is part of the sale, so add that to the total of what was spent. 

There's a bill that is currently being looked at that will make any purchase under $600 non taxable. Until this is passed any purchase is taxable!",309,1

2,"So, with the way Electrum sets up SegWit wallets, most mining pools and exchanges **don't yet recognize** those addresses. This is because Electrum uses ""full-SegWit"" bech32 implementation.   

To work around this, you can create the more ""backwards-compatible"" BIP49 implementation of a SegWit wallet via Ian Coleman's website then import into Electrum.

Here's a step-by-step.

**Note: Please take all available security precautions when generating your seed--VPN, https, firewalls, etc.**

1. [Go to this site](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) 

2. Click ""BIP49 derivation path"" and generate. Those fifteen words are your wallet seed.

3. In Electrum, File-->New/Restore-->Standard wallet and click ""Next""

4. Select ""I already have a seed"" and click ""Next""

5. Click ""Options"" box and check ""BIP39"" Seed then click OK

6. input fifteen words from Ian Coleman's site and click ""Next""

7. On the ""Derivation"" screen, replace **m/44'/0'/0'** with **m/49'/0'/0'** and click ""Next""

8. If you want wallet key encryption (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) enter a strong password and store it somewhere safe, then click ""Next""

9. Look at your wallet's addresses: they should all begin with ""3"" (if they don't, start over with a new seed).

10. Enjoy your new SegWit backwards-compatible P2SH-P2PKH wallet.

Bitcoin users can help lower transaction fees and contribute to bitcoin by switching to SegWit addresses and encourage wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**SUMMARY**

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work on integrating it. Others, such as Zebpay in India [have already implemented SegWit](https://blog.zebpay.com/how-zebpay-reduced-bitcoin-transaction-fees-a9e24c788598) and are reaping the benefits of reduced transaction fees. If bitcoin users demand SegWit now it will temporarily relieve the transaction backlog while more even more advanced solutions such as Lightning are developed.

Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it.

There is an opportunity now for all bitcoin users to individually contribute to help strengthen and improve the bitcoin protocol. At this point, the process requires a bit of work/learning on the part of the user, but in doing so you'll actually be advancing bitcoin and leaving what could turn out to be a multi-generational legacy for humanity.

__________________________


**BACKGROUND**

On Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

- SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

- Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

- Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

 [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

 [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

- It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses – Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress – use so-called “nested P2SH addresses.” This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address – starting with a “3” – and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to existing wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

 Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

- P2SH starts with ""3...""

 bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
Which addresses can I send from/to?

- P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backwards compatibility

 bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum

 [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)

Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? 

- The address starting with a ""3..."" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address. The address starting with a ""bc1..."" is a bech32 SegWit address that can only be sent to from newer wallets that support bech32.

Now you must use a wallet that supports the protocol, but switching wallets is not all that easy to do. Well never fear, today I am announcing the Bitcoin Payment Protocol Interface. This is a piece of software which lets you interact with the payment protocol manually so that you don't have to switch to using a new wallet software.

The program will take in a bitcoin URI (such as the ones that Bitpay gives out) and it will fetch the payment request data. It then decodes it and shows it to you. You will get to see the addresses to send to and how much. Then, by just following the instructions, you will be able to complete the protocol manually instead of needing a wallet which supports it.

The project is written in Python and has both a command line interface and a GUI. It can be found on Github: https://github.com/achow101/payment-proto-interface

3,"I’ve been wondering this for a long time.

Is the $10,000 limit the maximum amount of bitcoins you can initially buy, or the maximum cost of the goods or service you are buying?

You can read it 2 different ways.

They say “provided the COST of the Bitcoin is under $10,000”. They don’t say “provided the cost of the PRODUCT or SERVICE is under $10,000”

So I would assume that if I bought $9990 worth of Bitcoin and it went to $1,000,000 in 3 years time, I don’t have to pay any tax provided I spend the bitcoin on items directly from my Bitcoin wallet?

Obviously if I cash out anything to fiat, or pay for an item that is asking for AUD (eg: Living Room if Satoshi services) it’s would be taxable. 


That’s what it sounds like to me! How do you guys read it?


From the ATO website:

Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less.

None of it makes any sense at all. If they tax us at-the-time, it means we have to liquidate the asset to pay the effective tax on it. But that means any loss from volatility is a capital loss. So they take our money, and give us paper losses in return. 

The only way that makes sense is to pay the tax on the cashout into fiat. But that raises issues for the ATO as well, because that means you can mine, claim electricity and not pay a darn thing in tax and drain the damn tax system by hindering tax gains to the Government.

In China they have apple pay and same deal, no one uses it. But they also have wechat which is a mobile version of facebook, which everyone (~750M users) has, and wechat has a wallet similar to Apple Pay which everyone uses. I used wechat wallet for 10 days and I can safely say it was a transformative experience. You first link it to your bank account, walk into eg a 7-11 or starbucks, buy a drink, you scan your phone and that's it. Instantaneous. You send money to one of your contacts or say a taxi driver or top up your mobile phone. You book and pay for an uber or a hotel. The receipts come straight to your wechat account. In ten days I didn't touch my actual wallet and when I left and had to go back to paying cash or card I was really quite sad. It was actually fun to use. I even managed to get an instantaneous refund from walmart when I bought the wrong size clothes (easy to do in china). Basically for wechat users the credit/debit card is history and so is cash. I have seen the future and I like it. Yesterday I was standing in line and some woman was fumbling in her purse for some change and I had to bite my lip. Perhaps one day wechat will be able to be topped up with crypto but using it with the existing banking system gave me the same thought as you. What do I need crypto for again? Perhaps anonymity but very rarely. ",7,0
1,"I think you're missing what value Bitcoin actually brings to the table. Bitcoin wasn't invented to make you rich or to transfer money cheaply to save you money.

Although it isn't written directly into the code or mathematics, it's mechanics and structure as described in the white paper speak louder than words. That is, what is implied cannot be understated.

Bitcoin's unique property comes from decentralization. You've heard that before, but why do we care about such a thing? Because we've seen what centralization does. The abuse of power that comes from centralization is documented throughout history. And it hasn't been stopped by democratic government. Net neutrality? Trashed. Temporary ""Patriot Act"" to infringe on all your constitutional rights in the name of security? Yeah, that's permanent. Big bank bailouts? Sure. National ID (Papers)? Coming soon.

So how does Bitcoin fit into solving this? It's really three ways in my mind:

1. By stopping the government from being able to print/create infinite amounts of dollars and thus creating an insidious and immoral tax on your savings in order to fund endless wars and unjustified/illegal abuses of money and power around the world.

2. A brilliant seed of intellectualism that can begin to spread into the rest of the world that desperately needs it. That is, a system of mathematical certainty (in the form of cryptography) to back economic principles guided by logic and non-aggression rather than political motivations. This has the potential to undo the damage done by ""every stupid voter's voice still counts"". In Bitcoin, everything is a meritocracy. There are consequences to stupidity on many levels. From rash/buggy/incorrect decision-making on the protocol level to the rash/idiotic decision-making in terms of over-investing or buying/selling improperly. This system has the potential to start educating people, brilliantly disguised as a get-rich scheme. We've learned in 2017 that attacks like BCash and Miner's Voice are not significant. And those who thought incorrectly were burned. We witness attempts to attack Bitcoin on many fronts, with the conjuring of conspiracy theories and non-intellectual discussions which is resisted by those who can make better intellectual decisions. Propaganda systems are actually weak against Bitcoin, because mathematical truth cuts through the noise like butane flames through butter.

3. Redistribution of wealth which will free many minds from government slavery. Imagine what would happen if massive numbers of people who owned Bitcoin grew large, and those people no longer needed to work? Some would retire, live a life of luxury, or whatever their ""affluenza"" disease makes them do. But those people are pretty much lottery ticket winners. These are pure speculative investors, and they don't control Bitcoin or will be part of creating a new future. Then there are those who save their wealth in Bitcoin (notice, I didn't say invest). These people believe that the government has gone too far, it's destroying the planet and humanitarianism of civilized people. When you take people with such a mindset, and empower them with the ability to quit their meaningless job and start to poke and prod at government, this is a huge and healthy threat to government. What happens when 10%, 20%, 50% of the population simply doesn't have to work as much because the value of Bitcoin can sustain them? Well, the government will likely step in before their own currency implodes with rules attempting to ban Bitcoin or even taxing Bitcoin at 50% or emergency Bitcoin tax at 90% in order to ""save the economy"". And these people, who don't have to work, will have plenty of time to counter the government in all directions - legal, political, and in extreme cases physical.

Will there be a 2nd American Revolution? I don't know for sure. 

But what Bitcoin has planted here, is an opportunity for non-aggression principles to spread to rid the disease of corrupt governments, endless war, environmental destruction, extreme poverty, global inequalities, anti-intellectualism (in turn creating stupid voters), immoral greed and capitalist problems, and finally take a step towards peace.

So if you're feeling uneasy about Bitcoin, you're probably still in it for the quick gains. Which is fine, and I hope you do make a lot of money. If you do, spend the new free time you have to learn about the bigger implications. But if you're in Bitcoin for these reasons that I described above, the price doesn't matter, ""HODL"" never-ever needs to be repeated, and it is almost unconscionable to perpetuate earth's destruction by doing otherwise.

- Governments cannot regulate crypto. They will get they're cut in taxes. Evade taxes at your peril.
- To the other poster, new cryptos may work better because they are less used. Also, Bitcoin is able to morph and integrate new ideas if it benefits the currency. It's not written in stone.

But say, in 5 years your bitcoin cash is worth more and you claim it then?  You owe back taxes and interest for the last 5 years.

I think on this one, if you never claimed your bitcoin cash and don’t want anything to do with it, and you never “received” it or spent/sent/or did anything else with it, you don’t need to do anything.  

It’s tough.  There’s also a rule that you cannot have undeclared crypto and this would kind of be against that law too if you don’t pay taxes on it now but claim it later.

First of all, Kraken has the potential to be the best Bitcoin exchange, at least for US residents. Low fees, great record on security, great margin rates. But their problems are just intolerable at this point, even for a loyal customer like me who has done over 250k in trades there.
On December 23rd at 10:40pm EST, I emailed my driver's license because, apparently, my original upload from months ago was apparently no good, even though I got no message that it was no good, even when I tried to withdraw to my US bank account and it failed, I couldn't find out the reason till I emailed and asked several weeks ago and waited a week for a response. Around the same time I emailed my driver's license, I realized my factory data reset of my phone wiped out all my Google Authenticator codes, and I was completely locked out of my account. I submitted a support request around 11:48pm EST and got an auto response asking for additional details if I was still locked out. So I sent them at 12:08am on December 24th and waited patiently. Every couple of days after I tried to contact them BEGGING for a response, that I was completely locked out, putting  URGENT in the subject. Now, please note, my email with my driver's license was made less than an hour and a half before my request to let me log in. I have an open Bitcoin margin position that I have been nervous about plus some funds that I would like to do things with.
I received a response to my driver's license submission December 29th, 2:56pm EST and still have not received a response to my lock out request. The only sense I can make out of it is that they don't respond to tickets on the weekend or holidays so maybe, hopefully, I'll get a response on the 2nd. If that's the case, I'm sorry, but that's completely f--king ridiculous. I don't like to work on the weekends or holidays either, but this is a 24/7 business they got themselves into, and you pay people extra or do whatever you have to do to get enough support staff to work 24/7. Additionally, if it takes you a week to respond, you hire more people. Get your sh-t together Kraken and make billions! Do it and I'd be happy to invest in you.
Does anyone know what I can do to get into my account since Kraken won't help me?

So for example, if I made $1000 of profit from buying and selling crypto over the course of 2017, on which I owe 30% short term capital gains tax on (based on my ordinary income, if I held for more than 1 year then it would be a lower “long-term” capital gains rate) then my tax liability due as of April 15, 2018 would be $300. However, if I find something to sell that has actually lost me money, like buying $1000 of BTC at the height and now I’m down 30%, then selling this position would offset the $300 gain and I would owe nothing as of this April.

3,"I first came across crypto currencies in 2013. Played around with some alt coins, lost interest and like many misplaced/lost my first wallets. Since then I’ve been using Bitcoin on sites that accept it, normally buying BTC at the time and using it immediately, mostly to get around extra banking fees when buying things across boarders. You can imagine when Bitcoin broke records a couple of weeks ago and the small change I had in my wallet was turning into spendable amounts, realising the little money I spent for fun a few years back being worth more than 100 times that was a bit of a eye opener for me and I thought what is happening with Bitcoin today.

I do not see Bitcoin as an investment, or a get rich quick scheme but what I believe it is meat to be. The peoples currency so to say which is still relatively new. Unfortunately when I do spark up a conversation about Bitcoin in my region those that have heard it recently see it as a commodity, something like Stocks on an exchange or Gold, to invest in and not digital money for everyday use. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not looking to start anything with Hodlers and I know BTC is quite the sound investment long term but it wasn’t invented for that. I feel we’ve almost breeded a new type of banking system with Exchanges & Mining transaction fees. Currently I can’t buy small items with BTC anymore as in order to get the transaction through in time I have to spend more on fees than the actual transaction, and some sites have a order timeout so its just impossible. I know once things like LN and SegwitV2 are adopted things should and will be better but until that time we can’t use bitcoin for everyday average person use, but we will get there, I know we will and I want more people actively using BTC amongst them selves when we get there and not just day traders and holders.

I’ve set myself a goal , to get 1000 people in my region who do not have any Bitcoin onto Bitcoin during 2018, with a proper understanding of what the Crypto Currency is, How is works and runs, and I think most importantly how to keep it secure.

hear is my plan to get it done -  Introduce a person or business to Bitcoin as a currency and not a commodity, a brief break down of blockchain and how coin mining works and help setup their own BTC wallet on their smart phone or PC and ensure they have properly backed it up super safe. Setup or point them in the direction of BTC Exchanges and forums and where they can spend / save / buy BTC. Do a BTC transaction. If I do on average 3 a day I’ll hit my goal of 1000 in a year. Now I can do this on my own, but I would like to appeal for some help as this is for the greater good. Off the bat I do see a few issues to address. The time it currently takes to process a small transaction - I know this can be overcome currently by adding larger fees and even getting a miner to include your txid in a block and will ultimately be solved by the upgrades to the network so I’m not too worried, it just delays the start of me doing this.

Second issue is funds. Sure I can setup a few wallets and give some BTC, but 1000 adds up even on small amounts of $0.50, I'm no BTC begger, enough on the net and I know its not allowed here. However, I can’t do this part alone in a year, so I wanted to appeal to any individuals that think this could be a good cause and want to get involved somehow in growing the community with my idea either by getting people setup like I plan too or could even make a small transaction to a wallet address some point down to a new Bitcoiner... I love that BTC can be traced anywhere so I’m confident this could work and not too many will think too negatively of it. In the process of setting up a wallet a transaction to demonstrate the process of sending/receiving to an addresses will need to be done, I can’t just not do it for the sake of not spending. I’m thinking of a pay it forward style, get three people setup and get them to setup three people, if I do 1000 and they all do 3, by the end of it I've got 4000 new people using BTC in my region which is enough to start a viral like explosion of BTC use here. If others do it too then we’ll actively grow the community and ultimately BTCs value.

We’ll never move forward fast enough if we just use BTC on exchanges, and a few websites that accept it. The real power and potential of Bitcoin is when the people are using it amongst themselves. If we could pay our bills and for food with Bitcoin I’m sure a lot of us would,  but we won’t get there until we are using it as a currency and not a commodity. Actual currencies are worth less everyday, a dollar today does not you what a dollar did 5 years ago, but BTC rises,  1BTC 5 years didn’t get you much, but today.. well. So if you actively use BTC, and keep topping it up as you use it, normally its worth more down the line, if its not buy more BTC at its current price and use that. If a friend owes you money, give them a bit of a discount if they pay you in Bitcoin, ask all retailers not if but when will they start accepting it if they don’t already. Ask you landlord if you can pay them in BTC, your vet, your repairman, everyone. Lets get the masses onto it so it can be what it was meant to be, a decentralised electronic payment system for the people. Who is with me, any type of help support is welcome.

1,"> So heres the thing about a 7k bitcoin...It's still frickin amazing

This depends entirely at what price you entered the market.

If you bought in at $100 then yes $7k puts you miles ahead where you started.  Of course when it was at $20k you had 3 times as much money as you do now, but those are still very solid gains.

What if you bought at $7k last November and held until now?  You watched your money nearly triple on the way up from $7k to $20k and watched every single cent of gains disappear on the ride back down to $7k again.  These people probably lament not selling at the peak instead of thinking that $7k is a great price.

Now imagine you bought in at 10k, 12k, 15k, 18k or even 19.9k.  How do you feel about a $7k price point now?  Most people in that boat aren't too excited about btc at the $7k level.",90,0

> The technology looks to replace bitcoin’s existing signature scheme with one that mashes signature data together. The concept is so attractive partly because it clears up space in the blockchain, which should help resolve both the transaction backlog and high fees bitcoin users sometimes need to deal with.

...

> However, before SegWit implementation, it has not been possible to utilize Schnorr in Bitcoin.

...

> Four Bitcoin developers have released a paper outlining how Schnorr multi-signatures (‘multisig’) can help scale the Bitcoin Blockchain.

...

> Schnorr signatures are more efficient and compact than ECDSA signatures. 

 ...

> With Schnorr, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures.  [...] This means there’s more room for transactions. [...] As a side effect, a smaller transaction fee is achieved.

...

> Another major benefit of Schnorr signatures, is increased privacy

...


> In MultiSig, transaction inputs will only require one signature to represent all individual signatures, which is a “convenience” and data improvement.

...

> Combined with the CoinJoin protocol, Schnorr signatures allow users to combine their transactions and signatures at the same time.

...

> Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier estimated it would take several years for Schnorr signatures to be implemented.

...

> Schnorr’s signature would provide a reduction in transaction sizes anywhere from 19% for single input transactions, up to 40% when applied to multisig

0,"Greg is without a doubt underappreciated. Just in the fight against Jihan alone he deserves 10,000 medals.

However, it should be noted that this description pretends he has power that he simply does not wield. Consensus is the only power that gets any big code changes made in Bitcoin.

If there is any one thing that is not well described and understood in the entire bitcoin community, it is how decisions are arrived at between developers.  These smackdowns are a major part of that process. 

Greg is one of many great devs with a solid head on their shoulder who thwart the idiots trying to 'fix' bitcoin on a daily basis. For those who would like to study the process for yourselves, I highly recommend just jumping into the bitcoin development mailing list and watch, over time, how ideas arise & fall, or get made into bitcoin.

This doesn't fall on G.Maxwell more than any other more or just as active developers especially considering he doesn't have commit access (although commit access aka maintainers aren't really meant to approve/block changes unilaterally and instead are just there to verify the process/peer review/testing has been done & is up to standards).

And finally, bitcoin is not bitcoin core or any specific client. Users can run several different client today to follow and validate the bitcoin consensus rules. 
It's the users of the network who decide what consensus rules they follow (and therefore what define Bitcoin). If a consensus rule change is introduced by developers or other actors into bitcoin core (or into other clients) and it doesn't have consensus of the users/economic nodes then it will never become part of bitcoin's consensus rules (see fiasco of 2x).

Also similar misconceptions with the power of miners: if they want changes and need to fork the chain for it, if no users/economic node follow them they'd have just created an altcoin - just like what happened with bcash).",0,0

4,"I've mentioned before that I'm an old hand when it comes to Bitcoin but while it was nice to see the surging 'interest' in Bitcoin towards the end of last year, I was keenly aware that Bitcoin's utility had not scaled in proportion and the price was driven solely by institutional interest.

Retail interest is manipulated by institutional disposition towards Bitcoin. They own the media. They own your psyche, your thoughts, your decisions.

'What do you mean by institutional disposition?', you ask? Nation states and their banks.

If you think fiat price matters, I only have one question. What is Bitcoin to you? If the answer is 'a speculative asset to print new bank money', you should get the hell out of here and head over to the stock market.

The world we live in today is not a far cry from feudalism, even in so-called democracies, however much we are brainwashed into believing the polite fiction that is force-fed to us.

Banks are our feudal lords, each nation-state a fiefdom and every common man a serf. They print money out of nothing, inflating the economy and we keep paying interest on nothing, all the while diminishing the purported value of the money we hold which was created from nothing.

Why does nothing have value at all? Because we endorse this paradigm. Borderless currency is bad news for this paradigm.

Now let me tell you what Bitcoin really is,

Bitcoin is a new economic paradigm, where, for the first time in the history of money, every man gets to live in a truly democratic society with economic autonomy.

Bitcoin is not an asset that has value in bank money. Bitcoin is here to destroy bank money. Bitcoin is the everyman's money.

Bitcoin's true value will be its own purchasing power. How will Bitcoin have purchasing power? The same way bank money obtained purchasing power.

We just need to endorse this brave new paradigm. 'We' does not include banks or nation states, but we, the people!

Bitcoin is ingenuity. Satoshi is to Economics what Darwin was Evolution and Galileo to Science.

Most of us are just too benighted and brainwashed to appreciate the power of Bitcoin.

What would happen if we all ditched the bank money they keep printing out of nothing at will and bought into Bitcoin?

Is this the Calm before the Storm? ...any thoughts guys?

u/Moosecountry05 - 3y

With over 300 million in Venture Capital Funding for Bitcoin, all the new innovations and big players about to move in from the wall street and the start ups we don't even know about yet that are being worked on. I feel like everyone is playing hush hush, and one morning we all will wake up to a huge media blitz on how bitcoins being traded for over 1000 on the stock markets and other country's are joining the band wagon and push it up to 2,000. There's so many people in high places that have invested into Bitcoin that they would be able to push it mainstream to get back there money, just a matter of when.

In my uneducated opinion, it is very unlikely to hold for a long period of time at stable prices. Investors are terrified of bear markets as they don't want to see their money shrink. But as soon as the bear market finishes- and there is stability- the fear will disappear and investors will rush in. As soon as they start to do this, signs of a bull market will appear, causing even more investors to rush in, creating a virtuous circle (for those of us who got in before anyway), causing the next in a long line of bubbles.

18,"A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Users

The Techbros (see also The True Believers) - they're really into the internet of everything.  They think analog money is antiquated.  They're digital 24/7 and money should be no exception.  They're huge believers in the future of blockchain and can nerd out in the technology all day long.  Hodlers highly present. Subset of Techbros are the True Believers that think Bitcoin has the power to change the world, right all wrongs, create equality where there is none.

The Criminals - Bitcoin is merely utilitarian.  It allows easy transfer in exchange for contraband.  It provides an avenue of commerce for all kinds of illicit behavior from illegal drugs to sex trafficking to terrorism to money laundering.  

The Day Traders - they're not in it for the tech, they're in it for the rush.  They couldn't care less about blockchain (hell, they might not even understand it). They see a volatile asset that can be exploited for gain.  It could be oranges for all they care - anything that moves this fast can be profited off of if you know how to play the game.

The Hedge Funds - Institutional traders that agglomerate huge sums of capital that can be then used to manipulate markets.  It's a market and they're going to be present because they can move it or because they can manage the risk.  

The Libertarians (see also former Goldbugs, and Trumpkins)- fringy right-wingers that distrust central banks, and really, government of all kinds.  They think money should be deflationary and hate the idea that central banks can ""print money"" and undermine the value of their cash.  For some reason the idea of storing wealth in other assets that rise in value never occurs to them and they often confuse assets with money. They're highly resentful that trades in bitcoin are taxable events and hold things like ""taxes are theft"".  The extreme libertarians trade in conspiracy theories about jews and global banking.  In a prior generation they would have been advocating for return to a gold standard - this is the new gold standard to them.  

The Black Hats - Anarchists (left and right) that want to burn the system down.

Aunt Sally - Aunt Sally doesn't know anything about bitcoin really, but she's heard people talking about it and she's curious enough to put some money into it.  Aunt Sally has a lot of questions.  She's a little disappointed in you right now.

FOMOs (see also bandwagonners) - *sigh* these are lambs lead to the slaughter.  They see people around them getting fabulously wealthy instantly and want in.  They tend buy at the steepest part of the chart on the way up, and sell at the steepest part of the chart on the way down.

The Ruskies - Russians are exceptionally adept at identifying any weakness in western hegemony and then driving a wedge into it.  Bitcoin provides yet another avenue to throw a stink bomb into the system.  Their use is purely exploitative.  ",3,0

1,"See, perhaps I'll be downvoted for this sort of thing, but this is the sort of news that gets me thinking that Bitcoin hasn't delivered, and I doubt ever will deliver, on the dream of ""beating the system"". It might change it somewhat, it might have to adjust, but I don't buy into the anarchocapitalistic utopic dreams of some.

Let's call it the ""house"", as in the saying ""the house always wins"". The ""house"" being international banking, oil companies, IMF, WTO, Davos Forum, US government, the CIA, corrupt politicians, whatever. The guys with money, and their henchmen. Some people dream Bitcoin can beat the system - beat ""the house"".

What I see here is it might help beat the Venezuelan government, and the wreck the Bolivar by contributing to the hyperinflation as people perceive the Bolivar as more and more worthless and try to park whatever money they can on USD black market, crypto, whatever. Crypto has the special property of its transactions being hard to track and you can't easily find out who is in possession of BTC and how much. It's like USD black market, but ""superior"" in some aspects.

Well, one thing I can say for sure is the Venezuelan govt. and the Bolivar are not the system, the system is actually their enemy and BTC here can only collaborate with it.

On the other hand before BTC would ever ""save"" people from the Dollar, and the international banking/financial system, or even the Chinese regime we would see any manner of drastic measures to protect the real powerful and these stronger institutions. Best case scenario for BTC ""beating"" the house, is the house just joining it and buying into cryptocurrency world for greater gains, corruption and fraud than we have ever seen.

It doesn't matter how much BTC you are HODLing, the house has taken note of cryptocurrency and we have shady characters manipulating it and profiting many times more. The world of cryptos is like a wild west, we have stuff like USDT in exchanges that is like, a dollar, but not a real dollar that can be redeemed with actual dollars and yet it has likely manipulated those markets massively. I am convinced crypto markets today are on par, or perhaps more shady and underregulated than the regular financial market, 95&#37; of things traded have no value (shitcoins), it's more casino than Wall Street.

So however smart we may think we are by buying / HODLing some BTC / investing small time in crypto, they will outsmart you and own it, as they always do.

But Venezuela? Heh, maybe it can ""save"" Venezuelans from Maduro by breaking their currency and making Venezuela a failed state. Way to go for the e-currency revolution.

As a disclaimer, this is not to detract from the tech itself which gets ever more impressive in my opinion. It always impresses me that bitcoin **works**, today, as actual money. The system works, and it was never hacked. It just feels so futuristic. But I just don't think blockchain tech alone will defeat the powerful.

I am personally more of a fan of next generation blockchain projects like ETH and their cousins though. If NEO in China promises to bring innovative computing to make the system more efficient and clean, and delivers on the promise, I think it's a win. I'm okay with it not being a ""rebel"" coin. I don't believe in ""rebel"" coin tearing down the status quo. It's more convenient than fiat sometimes personally but that's it for me.

So far I have seen no sign that crypto money is bringing the financial elites to their knees, ever. What I do see in news concerning Venezuela is it potentially collaborating with them to breaking a rebellious regime and putting the country back in line. When it breaks, they come in and profit, nothing new. New ""democratic"" regime comes in, takes massive loans from IMF, massive austerity measures to ""fix"" everything, privatize PDVSA and its oil for Exxon-Mobil / Shell / whoever, so on and so forth. Lots of profit to be had, and let's be honest, mostly in Dollars.

They then waitd for the price to hit about $5800, and did the exact same thing again.

0,">""We're stuck in time... We can't move forward and backward in time...""

Au contraire Neil.  We absolutely can - in our minds... and in doing so, we effect *actual* reality.  

When Steve Jobs delivered his [Stanford Commencement speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA) in 2005 he said the following:

""You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.""  

Looking back on our past enables us to look to it from different perspectives, gain new insights and *change that past*.  We've all had that ""Aha!"" moment when new information in the present casts our understanding of past events in a new light and we then reorder our memories... In doing so, we effectively *change* that past.  

You're probably familiar with the maxim:

""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past."" — George Orwell

Things get really interesting when we *collectively* begin to re-order our understanding of the past.  In fact, that's what's going on in the bitcoin world en masse, as millions of people began to ask ""Why did Henry T. Ford say there would be revolution before breakfast if the average person understood banking?""

As politicians and ordinary folk on the street begin to look into the history of banking and have collective ""Aha!"" moments, those (no doubt with good intentions) who sought to control the past have less and less authority over the present.  Just as those that sought to maintain segregation during the civil rights movements of the past began to lose their grip of that particular reality.

And so we begin to look toward a different future as a new adjacent possible comes into view.

That future is a battleground of ideas and information. They who have greater access to truthful information in this new collaborative era are better able to join those dots moving forward since there is less noise to cut through and, more importantly, less competition over ideas of what that future might look like thanks to consensus driven frameworks that allow the best ideas to take hold with less friction. 

**The greatest force multiplier on the planet has always been technology.**  

Steve Jobs was able to time travel 10 years into the future by imagining a world of smartphones in his minds eye and convincing the world to go in that direction.  Satoshi was able to do the same with the bitcoin whitepaper.  Before satoshi, Tim Berners-Lee who imagined what a world where every computer was connected might look like.  Before him, Captains of the great pirate ships that controlled information and trade routes and were the first humans to realise (and see the implications of) the world not being flat.

Whilst no-one has absolute control or authority over the future since there are way too many chaotic events that will unfold as the dots are being joined...  one can attempt to ""fight all the battlegrounds of ideas at once"" in the minds eye, and instantiate 'backup plans' for the various possible futures that may unfold.  In fact governments and think tanks are thinking 10-50 years ahead all the time - it's how we've gotten this far as a species. 

Computer scientists and engineers are very good at building backup plans.  Taking unintended consequences into account is what all good programmers do when designing fail-safe systems.

The complex part the modern world has faced in all this has been keeping up with the sheer pace of change now that the moving variables (and unintended outcomes) are being compounded by the speed of instantaneous (and democratised) information transfer that the internet has brought about... Consensus driven 'hive mind' networks like bitcoin will increasingly be used to augment the role of old world institutions that used to do all this in the paper-belt world.  

**None of this is new.**

In antiquity the role of shaping the future of humanity was carried out by the [Pythia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia) - high priestesses of the Delphi in Ancient Greece - who would make a number of prophesies that people would act upon.  These Oracles would give advice intended to shape future action, which would be implemented by the supplicant seeking advice.  These supplicants would be known as ""consultants"" and would leave the Oracles and carry out certain duties on the basis of their advice.  By virtue of the wide-ranging information networks the Pythia had been exposed to they were, in essence, polymaths 

There were other oracles (or prophets) like Jesus, Moses, able to do a similar thing...  Note how well travelled they were in the stories and the sheer amount of novelty they had been exposed to above and beyond the average citizen.  They too were polymaths able to shape the future and change reality in profound ways.

Amazing material scientists like Neil who fail to see reality is made out of language and thought... get all caught up on the whole ""did Jesus exist?"" thing and rather miss the point... Carl Sagan (my favourite scientist of all time) even missed this when he said ""Astrology is bunk, the position of the planets at your birth has far less effect than the gravitational pull of the midwife delivering you.""  

That's irrelevant: all that matters is that the inter-subjective systems of belief that dictate the alignment of those stars will define the kind of character traits you are likely to have in life...  That, and the attachment we have to the various symbology we surround ourselves with that imbue those belief systems with certain powers (Scorpions are scary and dangerous, Lions are brave and noble etc).  A [Nazar amulet](youtube.com) wards off evil in the exact same way a modern depiction of the iris below a CCTV camera sign does.

So... if enough people in China believe a person being born in the year of the Fire Dragon is going to be a great powerful leader then they are going to subconsciously give preference to Fire Dragons over, say, Water Rats when selecting for the position of a CEO.  Therefore, Fire Dragons *do* hold more power in this world because of that selection bias... That makes it a self-fulfilling prophesy.  And it absolutely *does* matter what star you are born under, no matter what material scientists that fail to see *actual* reality, have to say about it.

I mean, I assume Neil knows - like all good material scientists ought to - that a bank note is less valuable than shit (since things grow from shit)... Yet I don't hear him telling the world that money is not 'real'.  Neil himself, is subject to the same power of belief structures as the astrologists he will pooh-pooh.

**""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.""** 

Astrology, Jesus, Capitalism, Hollywood: it's all 'real' if people *believe* it is 'real'; just like money and bitcoin are 'real' because we 'believe' them to be so.

If you want to know what the future looks like then, you only need to travel there in your mind like Steve Jobs did and ask yourself what you would like that future to look like.  If the vision you have is something you think would be of benefit to the other 7 billion humans on the planet, then there's a high degree of probability your vision is gonna' come true as soon as it [crosses the chasm](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) of belief and gathers the network effect.

5,"It is my strong belief that ""Time"" is the most valuable resource that we Humans have access to...

As Neil deGrasse Tyson so eloquently quoted ""[Time is defined to make motion look simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPOR55M_P0)""; what he's saying here is that the only reason we have a ""need"" for the concept of ""Time"" is to allow us a unit of measurement to describe motion effectively...

There is evidence that Time is our most valuable resource when you look back in History: The first accountants were ""time-keepers"" ie. the first astronomers! They first used motion to delineate a unit of time by realizing the Sun that rises and falls, this is presumably the first unit of time ever invented. This smaller unit of measurement (day) was used to delineate and measure other movements of greater celestial objects and eventually it helped us figure out where we were in the galaxy! It is no coincidence the first accountants were accountants of time or ""time-keepers"", it is VALUABLE!

[A drawing of early astronomers, accounting for \\""Time\\"" by using the motion of celestial bodies...](https://preview.redd.it/wsztcwo697711.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f229814efc49e21cabed689c5ff5c8dc3e351b4a)

They knew not what they were measuring, but they didn't need to know, they saw something repeat; thus a unit of time was created... If you have something that repeats predictably, you've created a time-keeping mechanism...

One could argue that Time is the only resource we truly ""have"", but one could also successfully debate that ""Time"" itself is a tool to help us accomplish things more predictably, thus preserving a bit of Time... This is quite literally the only use we have for Time, it is primarily why we invented it back when our ancestors looked at stars...

[Ask somebody for ALL their Money, and then ask them for ALL their Time, same result?](https://preview.redd.it/lk3osuzu97711.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92274ae64e097dd3fe9e2a8f2bfcca7d6bc99563)

If something saves you time, it is money... The reason is because Time IS money... When you buy a pack of bubble gum, you are buying the time necessary to create that product. When you work, you get paid for your time. Time IS money... This is why when you give somebody money and then wait a few years, you should expect a return of some kind, you gave them the money PLUS the time, this is the entire reason why ANY interest EVER is paid on ANYTHING... TIME!

The man who can waste somebody else's time is truly wicked, but that is a subject for a different post, let's get right to the Hero:

Lightning Network

Now that you know the importance of time, and therefore money, you should see the potential lying dormant in the Lightning Network...

We have planes that can cross the Atlantic Ocean faster than any form of Global Money; this is truly unacceptable for the 21st Century, Lightning Network will solve this problem, and it will do it quickly...

* Step 1: ""What tf is this Bitcoin thing?""

* Step 2: Read about bitcoin(the currency), completely oblivious to Bitcoin(the protocol)

* Step 3: ""I don't like Bitcoin, but i like the underlying technology, Blockchain."" (aka I dont understand Bitcoin or Blockchain but want to sound cool)

* Step 4: ""I still hate Bitcoin, but now I like the alternatives more!"" Proof of Stake! Proof of Unicorn Dust!

* Step 5: Still doesn't understand Blockchain, but invest in shitcoins anyway.

* Step 6: Shitcoins pump. *Adds 'crypto investor' 'ICO advisor' 'Blockchain Expert' to their social media bio.*

* Step 6: Shitcoins dumps. *loses life savings.*

* Step 7: Somehow Bitcoin is to blame for this. ""It is all the Bitcoin supporters' fault for bad mouthing my favourite shitcoin and now they are worthless!""

* Step 8: ""Oooooh a new shitcoin. Shut up and just take my money already!""

* Step 9: Gets rekt by pump and dumpers again. *loses whatever remained of their life savings.*

* Step 10: Somehow it's the Bitcoiners' fault again, but this time for not doing more to warn you to stay away from shitcoins. *Tells all their friends to stay away from Bitcoin*

* Step 11: ""Fuck Bitcoin, I'll focus on Blockchain."" *shamefully removes 'crypto trader' and 'ICO advisor' from Instagram bio, keeps 'Blockchain Expert' title.*

* Step 12: ""Oh new shitcoins!"" But now is left without any money to invest so they asks their family and friends to invest in a new 'next big thing since Bitcoin' every 3 months.

* Step 13: *Family and friends loses life savings.* Gets ostracised by family and friends. But somehow, Uncle Tom managed to get out before the dump and now he just bought a new Mercedes. *Goes into a silent jealousy rage.*

* Step 14: Still doesn't understand Bitcoin or Blockchain, but starts writing blogs about why no one would care about Bitcoin, and why only Blockchain will work. Title goes something like ""10 reason Bitcoin will fail/is a scam"" ""Bitcoin is a fad, but Blockchain will live on and change the world""

* Step 15: *Gets bombarded by people in the space for writing these articles with a complete lack of understanding on Bitcoin and Blockchain.* Suddenly you turned yourself into a meme.

* Step 16: Gets ostracised by the Internet. Fades away in shame.

* Step 17: *Research about Bitcoin (properly this time) to write a more nasty article to prove yourself right.*

* Step 18: Read the Bitcoin whitepaper from cover to cover for the first time. ""wait a minute..""

* Step 19: Read about Wei Dai's experiment on b-money, Nick Szabo's bit gold, Adam Back's Hashcash, and Hal Finney's Reusable Proof-Of-Work (rPOW). ""wait... mind blown, why didn't anyone show me these before""

* Step 20: Read books from Nassim Taleb. ""wait... now i kinda get it""

* Step 21: Finished reading 'The Bitcoin Standard' by Saifedean Ammous. ""Holyshit! Mind blown x20""

* Step 22: Congratulations, you are now enlightened. Now you understand the history of money, the Gold Standard, what is inflation, what is central banking, what is Bitcoin, why was it created, what were its predecessors and why they didn't work out, how does Bitcoin(the protocol) work, and why the world needs a decentralised leaderless, censorship-resistant protocol like Bitcoin.

* Step 23: You realised the path of Bitcoin enlightenment is a never ending journey, and you continue learning.",10,0

0,"This is an experiment that is playing itself out, we'll just have to wait and see for empirical evidence.

However, I don't think any system (inflationary, fixed, deflationary) will achieve price stability. Prices are better left being determined by the free market. What you can try to predict is market behaviour given different properties of money. With the existing system, we encourage short-term profiteering, conspicuous consumption, and reckless financial behaviour because we don't have the confidence that our money will keep its value in the future. On the other hand, a deflationary currency would encourage saving and spending only when necessary. Both have their laundry lists of pros and cons.

A key feature during deflationary spirals is the reduction of demand for that particular market. It could be the loss of confidence in the government (Turkish Lira was not heavily inflationary, yet the Lira tanked), sanctions by other nations (Iraq/Iran), other geopolitical black swan events. Switzerland enjoys currency stability, but also highly inflationary. It's more about the world's confidence in the currency which provides said currency its power rather than inflationary/deflationary designs. The more distrust the world has of the central bankers, the less stable their currencies are.

Bitcoin is deflationary by design, and completely predictable on the protocol layer. If the economy that uses Bitcoin grows, the per-unit value of Bitcoin proportionally increases also. On the other hand, deflationary spirals in fiat are unpredictable - sensitive to geopolitics and the decisions of the few. Another key difference is that fiat is debt-based, while Bitcoin is an asset - traditional economic models on deflationary spirals may not apply.

We'll see. If nothing else, the world needs to curb conspicuous consumption to be sustainable.",9,0
1,"You can transact Bitcoin today. No currency has ever reached a point of equilibrium where X currency always equals two sheep.  
There is no conundrum here, a deflationary currency doesn't encourage reckless spending and that is what we want. Do you really need that fancy car?

2,"At first people won't hodl like maniacs for a 1-2% increase in value. People will always consume and desire things that are luxury. IMHO a currency must reward saving as it provides capital for future improvements. If you are saving you are leaving the ressources available to others. The reward for spending is satisfaction in the now.

If people hodl too much prices go down  
either --> People spend more and prices go up  
or --> Production gets reduced and prices go up  

Now if production gets reduced jobs get lost. Catastrophe! Some would say. But actually if people rather save for a few percent gains then these products aren't really necessary. Also it results in reallocation of ressources where people actually prefer spending.  ",2,0
3,"There is a source of supply for btc, the most natural one: people who sell btc when the things they can get in return are too tempting.

4,Is your spacebar and spell check broken?,2,0
5,Hey use cases for currency is spending AND saving! Why would you accept a money that you would not save in? It would just be hot potato carnival tickets. I would want to save up for a kylo ren saber but if I tried to save in inflationary tickets I would only be able to buy an eraser in a month. So I guess im forced to go for the crayons and pixie stix now ugh.,1,0
6,"There's a lot of wrong thoughts about the usual currencies being ""inflationary"". Basically the banks try to reach stability, however the 2 percent inflation rate should help to keep up spending, it's not the big issue. The real sin was to go to the zero interest rates, which are against a stable logic of economy. There were times when a private guy could save money for an interest rate of 3 or 4 percent, overcompensating the inflation rate. With interest on interests, you could make 2000 bucks on top on interests within 10 years by saving only 100 per month. At zero risk! And for me it's also clear that borrowing money has to cost money (positive interest rate), this was the original business of stable and honest banks. So I am convinced that the people blaming the small inflation rate instead of the zero interest rate are barking at the wrong tree. It's good to see that the Fed, finally, is trying to get away again from the sick zero rate. 

And many people overlook that all banks do a lot of intervention at the markets every day to keep the currencies stable. Short-term stability of a currency is super important for day-to-day life, imagine that retail business is working on profit margins of 0.5 to 2 percent. So without intervention, currencies would jump up and down a bit more, and the mass psychology programmed into the trading computers would amplify these effects to make any currency look like today's crypto markets (not that strong of course, but for a major currency like USD or EUR, jumping 10 cents every day would be an economic nightmare already). 

Sorry for the long-winded foreword but it is important to see this first. Then finally, it's also important to look at the deflationary behavior of bitcoin. In a variation of Gresham's law, the deflationary currency will be held and not used in daily life, because you feel that you pay too much when using it. We see this with all the long-term ""hodlers"" just keeping it forever, waiting for the moon. I can see no way how people could be motivated to use a strongly deflationary currency in daily life, I guess they would rather go back to bartering or invent a substitute currency which is inflationary (see the principles of Gresham's law again). So the limited supply will be the really big issue: Instability could possibly be cured by mass adoption, but the deflationary approach will be even intensified by further adoption and will make the daily use more unlikely. So bitcoin's destiny by design is to be an asset for speculation. 


TL;DR It is not the small inflation rate but the illogical zero interest rate which puts economy at risk. Currencies are kept stable on short terms by intervention of the banks which is very important for economy. The deflationary design of bitcoin makes it a speculative asset rather than a currency, won't get better with further adoption, unfortunately. ",1,0
7,"Let me start of by stating that I am a big believer that BTC will stand the test of time,however,the issue I am having is the ability to envision how that future will play out.Allow me to share my conundrum and I would appreciate any feedback or opinions on this matter.

When one looks at the history of money one can notice that every single one of them withoit exception is inflationary.From seashells to gold.The more valuable they become the more incemtives there are for people to either mine(in the case of gold) or simply provide resources to find them(in the case of seashells).Eventually,you will get to one of 2 points.Either an equilibrium between supply and demand is reached causing price stability or the currency proves itself to be unreliable due to high inflation(the supply of seashells is too unpredictable to be able to properly value it).Now comes Bitcoin where the laws of supply and demand is turned upside down.It doesnt matter how much demand there is,the supply will continuously decline as time goes by.The block rewards are set and it is expected to continue to decline.The Hashrate climbing only indicates the competition to mine and the rewards are set no matter what.So how can BTC ever reach a point of equilibrium in order for it to be a stable mean of transacting?I have seen articles with estimates of 1 to 100 million $,however,even at those levels,what can provide the counter weight to the deflationary character of BTC to prevent it from becoming so high that its use case becomes limited to people HODLING it forever.This argument can also apply to many other cryptocurrencies and I have yet to see a rational reasoning as to why BTC will not remain in a deflationary spiral forever.",22,1

&#x200B;

I have scoured the web on this... but it seems absolutely no one knows how to report this on a tax return, even hypothetically. It's simple if you take Bitcoin out of it. I probably would have gotten a W-2G and reported it that way. If not, it would be up to me to report it myself, and the IRS could see the withdraw/deposit on my bank statement should I ever get audited.

&#x200B;

But the anonymity of it all is throwing me for a loop. Bovada doesn't know who I am, or care, and also doesn't keep long term track of bet slips. So the official documentation consists of a bank withdrawl, a bit coin purchase, a bitcoin transfer, and then a bitcoin transfer back to be for a lot more than I had to begin with.

&#x200B;

There is no way for me to ""prove"" I won that money through gambling. There is no way for me to quantify and prove the change in value of bitcoin between the time I bought it and the time I got my winnings.

Then you get a layer beginning from 2017, new ice but solid, been through some heavy storms but still forming at the top and willing to sell at some point, although if some didn’t at 3k, I don’t know what will make them sell.  


Then you have these new buys at at skyrocketing prices looking for continual gains, fresh snow and ice shards. Some will melt away, but a new layer of ice will surely form from the remains of every melt.

To me, it's an instant tip-off that the person saying it is as ignorant as fuck and never stops to double check whether a thing is true or not.

If there was a stack of printer paper, a few inches tall, almost 1000 sheets and it represents All Electrical Power produced and consumed on earth, Bitcoin would be one thin sheet in that stack -- AND -- three fourths of Bitcon's sheet of printer paper comes from renewable (hydroelectric, solar, wind, etc.)

* IF you're really that concerned, you're barking up the wrong tree, wasting your time

I've learned this is a general problem with journalism - very, very few journalists in *any* field have much more than the slightest idea. I learned this listening to healthcare workers complaining of obvious (to them) errors in reporting, teachers doing likewise. It came totally clear when a conversation I had with one was badly misunderstood by the time it got into print. Why are they not experts? It's unlikely that a Theymos or a Peter Todd would write the story, and undesirable too -experts are for us better employed elsewhere.

The clue is in the name: *journal*ism and not *expert*ism. Journalists record observations into a journal. About all the wise person can take away is that something (that may or not be what was described) happened at some point (that may or may not be when reported) and it affected person X in 'this' way - but might have been that way.

To an address you provide for this transaction. To generate a receiving address, you need to install a wallet, **back it up** (it will ask you to write down 12 or 24 words, this is your back up phrase.. take good care of it!), and then go to ""receive"" section of the wallet. It will show you an address (a string of letters + numbers, most likely starting with a ""3"" or a ""1"", but that's irrelevant for now).

Note in particular the mention Alito makes about this where he clearly states it's not just about wine here. 

""More recently, we observed that our dormant Commerce Clause cases reflect a “‘central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.’” Granholm, 544 U. S., at 472 (quoting Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325–326 (1979)). In light of this history and our established case law, we reiterate that the Commerce Clause by its own force restricts state protectionism.""

...""And Granholm never said that its reading of history or its Commerce Clause analysis was limited to discrimination against products or producers. On the contrary, the Court stated that the Clause prohibits state discrimination against all “‘out-of-state economic interests,’” Granholm, 544 U. S., at 472 (emphasis added), and noted that the direct-shipment laws in question “contradict[ed]” dormant Commerce Clause principles because they “de- prive[d] citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.” Id., at 473 (emphasis added).""

1,"I'm not sure what the difference is between systemic and price stability according to the author. Maybe someone here can explain this. He doesn't really say what he means by ""systemic instability"" except connecting it to crashes. But while ""crashes"" have led to bankruptcies of certain banks, the system itself has remained intact, albeit with a drop of prices and valuations. So I get the impression that he conflates the two concepts of price and systemic stability which sound catchy but seem to be congruent to a good extent.

At the same time he seems to define systemic stability regarding bitcoin exclusively as security without clarifying how this is a property lacking with traditional fiat currencies to a significant extent. This seems to be even more striking given that bitcoin hasn't taken over an important part of transactional tasks yet (at least compared to the fiat currencies), and especially not in times of ""systemic instability"". I'm not inherently critical of cryptocurrencies but I'd appreciate if someone could flesh out how the self-correcting and self-adjusting mechanism is smart enough to for instance not accidentally act pro-cyclically in times of crises - a property which can be better controlled in a system where humans can intervene when necessary.

In the EU bail-ins by law are only supposed to happen for amounts exceeding 100k EUR. Most people seem unconcerned as it's more than they have saved in their bank account. They rule out the possibility of these amounts being reduced in the future or not being followed through.

Generally - especially for the EUR zone - bail-ins on a large scale could lead to a currency reform. In this case the 100k will likely be upheld however any savings are reduced to say 1/10 of newly issued money...

But without trust in the government then the currency will free fall to it’s true value of zero. But when the time comes and people know the truth about how money works and more and more countries go to negative interest rates or hit a Great economic Recession then we will see adoption come at a pace unseen before as more and more people choose BTC to save rather then loosing money due to tax on deposits. 
So right now BTC is more of a speculative traders want and is helping the people who are utilizing it in places like Venezuela and is not a need for the rest of the world. When the everyday person is fearful of the dollar then that is when we will see mass adoption.
And if you didn’t know, technicals play the role for traders which is why we are not doing much right now as there isn’t too much new money and Fundamentals play a role for hodlers and as soon as everyone new is exposed to the truth that BTC is real money then the supply will continue to get gobbled up and price will have even faster corrections and new all time highs.",7,0

The last cycle showed us a pump after the halvening and after the explosive success of Ethereum. I also remember BTC really taking off after Trump was elected and tech stocks took off. In my opinion, existing bubbles are what make Bitcoin inflate. QE money takes time to trickle down to the normies, it only exists on bank balance sheets for now. Wait until negative interest rate panic sets in. Things are accelerating, won't be much longer the monetary system can hide everything in plain sight.

14,"During the past years I always thought I could see some correlation between a terrible thing happening in the world, which might influence the market, and the price of Bitcoin. More specifically in most cases the Bitcoin price would rise while e.g. stock prices would fall.

In recent times we had or still have conflicts concerning:  
\- Hong Kong  
\- Iran and Strait of Hormuz, influencing oil trade which has always been a major driver of the economy  
\- We had our fair share of Trump activity which influenced Bitcoin prices, however the recent impeachment announcement didn't seem to have much of an impact  
\- There are messages of the population of Venezuela and the Central Bank hoarding Bitcoin however, for a population of 38 million people I would have thought this would have had a bigger impact in the price and more specifically transaction volume, as Venezuela could actually be one of the first places where it was actually used as a currency and not for HODLING.  
\- ECB started quantitative easing again while some (the Dutch and German) Central banks are fiercely against  
\- Last week there where messages about the US and QE or quietly printing 75 billion

Finally I think adoption rate after being around for more than a decade is (at least in the Netherlands) low. People do not know how to use it, are scared of using it, or don't see the importance of using it. One of the reasons contribution to a low adaption rate in the Netherlands I think is banks seeing some of the technological improvements of Bitcoin and implementing it. Of course banks do not and cannot implement all the good stuff from Bitcoin as it is simply not compatible with the banking system, they can however implement some nice features the fiat muggles care about most. Most predominantly fast transactions and have now also introduced it e.g. Tikkie (which is an app to transmit small transactions almost instantly).

While I still believe in Bitcoin and Blockchain, after all these years, and all this shit happening in the wold, if the rest of the fiat muggles still do not understand Bitcoin when will be the moment they do?

Considering low adoption rate and little to no price influence of recent events I start to lose trust in the growth of Bitcoin, in the growth of the Bitcoin price and finally in seeing Bitcoin as an investment.

An 80% decrease in other assets would really strike panic in at least US domestic markets if not global markets. Historical crashes are:
1) The Great Depression of the 1930’s hit a total of 86% percent down. 
2) The 60’s to the 80’s saw around a 70% stock market crash. 
3) The Dot Com Bubble of the 90’s saw a 40% crash. 
4) The Sub Prime Mortgage Loan Crisis of 2008 saw a 50% crash.... 

Bitcoin has seen 80% “crashes”. This is Bitcoin’s fourth rodeo. I’m not sure what other stock (let alone, asset) can withstand 80% “crashes” and come back stronger. The first alternative asset I think of is the AMZN stock which fell 70%~ during the Dot-Com bubble. AMZN fell from $85~ to I roughly $20. Now each AMZN stock is worth roughly $1,725. Amazon did this once.

Bitcoin has done this three times before. This is an anomaly of an asset. 

Pairing the A) economic circumstances and social normalization of the word “recession” in 2019, while the B) political environment is looking quite hectic. “Revolutions” are happening in Venezuela, Iran, Hong Kong, India/Bangladesh, multiple African countries... and do we dare forget that C) the federal reserve, not just the US Government, is facing troubling circumstances with BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Russia and China already bypassing the US Dollar taxes in trading with other countries like Iran. 

It is quite a blessing to be involved in a wonderful asset like Bitcoin as early as 2019. After tried and tested “crashes”, the entirety of Bitcoin does not collapse like any other stock would.

Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets

Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.

Do not daytrade

Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 

Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well 

Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research

Do not invest your bitcoins in any investment schemes

9,"> Crucial advice for a beginner 

Welcome! First things first, do as much thorough personal research as possible before getting started in Bitcoin. The more familiar you can be with Bitcoin/the industry before buying, the better and more informed your decisions will be in the future. Research can include anything from reading articles, news, books etc to listening to Podcasts - whatever resources work best for you.

> What’s the best way? What do I need to know? 

Once you've done that \^ and feel comfortable with the topic, most beginners find it easier to buy from a Bitcoin exchange (an exchange is a company which sells Bitcoin, similar to foreign exchange companies). Which exchange you choose to use will be determined by where you live. For example, if you live in the UK/Europe, you might like to try buying [Bitcoin](https://www.coincorner.com/) from CoinCorner. We're an exchange that was founded in 2014.

Heh, transactions are atomic - they either happen 100% or not at all. Its not like transferring files. You publish a transaction and once its out there, it will get mined (unless you put an absurdly low fee on it).

3,"I also have a ledger. After your wallet creates the transaction to receive the coin from your exchange, it will show a link to view your transactions on a blockchain explorer website.

6,"The 24 words is to recover your hardware wallet if it's damaged or lost.  Write it down.  Put it in a safe place.  It's not to be used, generally speaking, any other time.   Your ledger can be protected by a pin.   The protection of physical ownership + pin is enough for most people.    Wallets containing $50 should be secured differently than wallets containing $5M.   Wallets intended to be touched often should be optimized for access with reasonable security.   Wallets that you touch once every 5 years on a long term investment can be optimized purely for security. 

You just need to familiarize with yourself with how the system works.

1. the owner of bitcoin in an address has a private key (think of it like a password that can be used to authenticate ownership of an address)
2. if you have that private key, you can transfer the bitcoin to another address.
3. private keys don't need to be stored in a hardware wallet, but it's scary if it's in a place easily accessible by software.
4. hardware wallets let you store it on a device and request signatures rather than the key be returned to the software.   This protects you since you can confirm on the device the way the software wants to use the private key.

Bitcoin is always in the cloud.   Once the system receives your transaction it will be processed.   Your PC is irrelevant.   ledgerlive is a nice little interface to access addresses and to sign transactions from your addresses.    As far as sending bitcoin from an exchange to your device, you just need to know one of your wallet addresses.   You don't even have to turn on your PC for that.   I have some written down.

Best practice is to generate a new address whenever you receive money -- it'll do that automatically in ledger live when you want to receive money there.   But old addresses work just fine.",1,0
7,"Keep in mind that your bitcoins aren't stored on your computer, and neither are your transactions. They are stored in the blockchain. Your wallet has the keys to access them.

We've been working on this one for quite some time now, but we're *very* excited to present you guys with [AgoraDesk](https://agoradesk.com), which happens to be **the world's first P2P OTC cryptocurrency options exchange.** With *physical settlement*, no less. And straight out of the gate we support BTC-based contracts. 

###Features

AgoraDesk's features include:

* No KYC/AML or verification (though some traders on the platform might ask you for verification themselves);
* Any currency, any payment method, anywhere;
* Cash and online Bitcoin trading (just like the other Local* sites);
* Bitcoin options trading (calls & puts);
* Options are settled *physically* (i.e. with the underlying BTC);
* Call options support both gross settlement and net settlement;
* Accounts, reputation and XMR ads/trades are completely shared with LocalMonero;
* [Onion portal](http://agoradeska6jfxpf.onion/);
* [I2P portal](http://agoradesk.i2p);
* [No-JavaScript version of the site](https://agoradesk.com/?version=nojs) (loads by default when accessing from Tor or I2P);
* Fully functional when Google is blocked by your browser;
* [Affiliate program](https://agoradesk.com/affiliate) - earn commission for inviting trading users;
* Multilingual: we support English, Russian, Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Italian, Portuguese and Spanish;
* Mobile notifications through telegram, so that you won't have to install yet another app on your phone just to get push notifications about your trades;
* Beautiful ads through the use of Markdown;
* 2FA (with TOTP apps like Google Authenticator or andOTP);
* Deposit and withdraw currencies other than BTC through [MorphToken](https://www.morphtoken.com) integration;
* Complicated pricing mechanisms through the use of price/premium formulas, not just for spot trading but also for options and their premiums;

As can be noticed from our feature set, AgoraDesk has quite the privacy bent.

### Why P2P OTC options?
Because until today one could only have access to these sorts of instruments if they went through tedious verification processes of the centralized exchanges. In addition, many countries/regions (even the US in some instances) are simply banned from accessing these instruments on most popular centralized exchanges. Since our platform is completely P2P and OTC (no standardized instruments), we can afford not to impose any such restrictions.

####Leveraged Trading for All
**Call options (i.e. the right to buy)**, for instance, can serve as an alternative to a leveraged long position upon the underlying asset. If you buy a call option for an underlying of $100 worth of BTC for a premium of $1 then you're in a position similar to a x100 leveraged long position. Initially, you only pay the $1 premium to the call option seller, and if the price increases x2 then you profit $99. *Pay $1, get 100$.* If the price drops, you simply let your call option expire, and your losses are limited to the premium you payed - $1.

**Put options (i.e. the right to sell)**, likewise, can serve as alternatives to a leveraged short position.

####Risk Hedging for All
In addition to ""leveraged trading"", calls and puts can be used to hedge yourself against price fluctuation risks if you happen to receive or make payments in BTC.

For example, you sell artworks and receive payment in BTC. Every month you pay expenses in USD: rent, electricity, internet bills, food, and so on. Assume your monthly USD expenses are $1000. Under the current BTC price, you make enough per month to cover your expenses, but you are worried that a sudden drop in the price might affect your ability to pay at the end of the month. To guard against this, you simply buy a put option with an underlying of $1000 worth of BTC that expires at the end of the month. If the price goes up - you let the option expire, sell your BTC on the spot market and reap the profit. If the price goes down - you exercise the option and are able to cover your expenses despite the price going down.

**These and many more advantages to be reaped from being able to trade options in a P2P OTC manner are now, *for the first time in the cryptocurrency industry*, available to the you.**

16,"""After recently seeing the posts about the 21 Million Club and the media write-up about it, I decided to do some digging into the numbers.

As many of you know, the 21 Million Club is a Reddit designation for those Bitcoiners that own 1 BTC or more. The 21 million is reference to the fact that only 21 million BTC will ever be in circulation. However, the designation makes it seem like (especially for newcomers) that there is or can be up to 21,000,000 in this club. Well let's check that and get a real estimate for the number of people in this exclusive club.

We know that there will only ever be 21,000,000 in circulation. However, there are 16,724,975 in circulation as of 12/5/17 according to the most recent data from blockchain[dot]info.

We know from recent studies that there are many bitcoins that are lost forever. I removed the Satoshi coins from the studies and averaged the difference to get an estimate of lost coins, which came to 2,304,824.

So, there are only 16,724,975 - 2,304,824 = 14,420,151 BTC, and therefore only a potential of 14.4 million current 21 Million Club members.

But let's dig deeper into what we know from the blockchain.

Satoshi is believed to have a stash of approximately 980,000. We will assume this as one BTC address and one person.

We can also see the largest holders on the blockchain. These are logged on bitinfocharts[dot]com. You can google ""top 100 richest bitcoin addresses"" and the site will provide the top 9900 BTC addresses. These 9,900 people account for an estimated wopping 9,870,340 BTC!

So, 14,420,151 [existing BTC] - 980,000 [satoshi BTC] - 9,870,340 [top 9900 BTC addresses] = 3,569,811 BTC. This means that 9,901 addresses hold roughly 78.65% of all the BTC that exists right now. That reduced our 21 Million Club members to 3,569,811 + 9901 = 3,579,711.

But let's dig deeper into some formulas to determine trends since many accounts have more than 1 BTC.

I took the top accounts with a maximum of 10000 BTC and plotted them on a power trendline coming up with the following equation:

y = 11880x -0.925

This formula allowed me to plot the rest of the addresses in 100 address groups. Using that formula and adjusting for the maximum BTC left, we can assume there are 801,713 addresses w/ 1 BTC - 156 BTC. Keep in mind this assumes no addresses with sub-1 BTC.

So, 9901 [largest address holders including Satoshi] + 801,713 [addresses w/ 1 BTC - 156 BTC] = 811,514 Addresses w/ 1 BTC Minimum.

So, the ABSOLUTE LARGEST estimate for the number of people in the 21 Million Club is 811,514. However, it is likely much much lower for the following reasons: 1) The analysis does not account for fractional BTC ownership at all, which is likely a very large portion of the BTC addresses, 2) It does not account for people that may control multiple addresses, which would further reduce the membership, and finally, 3) As time goes on the only people that will be able to purchase 1 BTC will reduce as the price goes up, making fractional ownership more common.

EDIT 1: The number also doesn't take into account distributed ownership. This could distribute in a number of ways but it would likely follow the same curve used for the estimate.

If you are part of the 811,514 or less, consider yourself lucky. You are in the top 0.01% globally. I saw this reported earlier as 0.3% globally, which is WAY OFF.""",81,1

There's so many different cuts, versions, encodings, formats, remakes, remasters, etc.  That if your heirs didn't use the same exact FILE that you used, it wouldn't be possible to decrypt.

Decrypting lyrics would seem far more probable, IMO.   But either way, it does sound like fun!",1,0
7,"Aaaand you've just reduced the search keyspace from 2^256 to 2^26. If you don't understand exponents, understand that is the difference between searching the known universe and searching a backyard.

The requirements to make it actually random result in you needing to roll your own crypto. Having no experience in randomness and programming, you will fuck up while trying to create this fun game. Even more so, now that you've posted your idea here, the thousands of hackers constantly searching for keys generated in idiotic ways will add song lyrics and methods of such generation to their search parameters.

It is insanely important to generate a truly random address. 

I can't find them now, but there have been several posts around 2011-2015 of people who lost coin because they thought it would be a good idea to use quotes from books or poems as their seed phrase. Even if you add more layers of protection/ randomness, you will not be able to do a good enough job to be confident in the long-term.

Addemdun: this is assuming, of course, that you pick a random song, which you won't. You will pick a common song from the top 10,000 or even 1,000,000 of the past 100 years, reducing search space even further.",1,0
8,"I am thinking about taking one of my favourite songs, and using it to generate the seed for a private key. Then, leaving the song with a cryptic message to some heirs with a legend that the song contains the seed for a bitcoin or ethereum wallet. 

Something along the lines of ""whosoever be able to decrypt this music shall receive my crypto"" type of thing. I want the journey for them to be as technical and magical as possible. I am obsessed with the idea of creating objects of power so to speak.

Does anyone here have any suggestions for software that can turn music into a seed? Obviously going with the lyrics is a start, but that isn't technical. I want to turn the actual music into a key.",10,1

Hopefully it will help illustrate that in our current global resources market there are both limited supply chains and unlimited supply chains, ie. crops, metals, oil...

2,"Just remember this guy said the price of bitcoin would never be more than an ounce of gold, ""impossible"" he said, and he said it just 12 months before it happened. 

Every year for the last 8 years he has said bitcoin is about to crash to zero. 

Right before bitcoin broke above 1k and ran to 20k he said it was going to zero.

He is a smart guy but his own father brainwashed him from a child into believing gold will be money again so in his mind nothing else could possibly be money. Also his age prevents him from understanding the differences between what bitcoin is and what he thinks it is.",8,0

Guy doesn't give a damn about crypto. But by talking about it, he knows crpyto idiots will get sucked into the argument and drop his name all over the web.
