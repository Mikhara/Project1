1,"This is exactly how new accounts get opened. If you turned it around and made them require you to open an account manually before accepting the money, it would be ineffective as a compulsory savings program. Should the employer hold onto the money? For how long? What if you leave the company/die before getting around to it? Should the employer pay interest on the money they've been holding? What if you never open the account, is that employer now going to disburse the money at retirement? Have you just lost it all? If the employer can keep it thats a terrible motivation for them to lie about how super works to young/foreign employees. If you can keep it now its not a compulsory scheme at all.",5,0

You could try a personal loan anyway as the banks here are fairly generous. Hell, you'd probably easily get a credit card here for $5k, I got a bigger one when I earned $200 about 10 years ago. Commbank are the easy ones of the banking world.

The interest costs are killing me, on top of that, having to transfer money internationally to pay off the card really isn't helping things.
If i was at home id balance transfer to a new zero interest account but with no job and residence in the UK, banks won't approve a new credit card.
I work mainly weekends due to the penalty rates so i earn on average $530 net a week, with an estimate of $250 in expenses. 

I was just wondering what the options are?
Ideally id like to get a personal loan, pay off the card and pay the loan off weekly to simply things and reduce costs.
I'm thinking that banks will not approve a loan on this visa even though id have no issues paying it back.

They may advise for you to have a different structure to what you are considering, and it depends on your needs and that's something you'll need to flesh out with him/her. 

You'll probably end up creating the /u/keji70gsm family trust which owns;

Keji Property Development Trust - This entity is involved in the JV with your QLD property developer

Keji Business Trust - This entity owns your business interests

This ""family trust"" is the one that will get the profits from the business and development trusts, and then will disperse them to yourself and your family personally as best suits taxation wise. 


This way the two entities profitable entities are separated from each other, but still funnel money through your main family trust for taxation reasons. I'd dare say they will be recommending a corporate trustee (Which means having a company as the trustee of the trust, instead of yourself) as a further level of asset protection on all trusts. 


I'd anticipate something like this will cost ~$4,000-$7,000 to setup correctly, including advice and time. 


I Don't know any good accountants in NSW sorry. Goodluck! Have fun!

1. start my own business without putting my name to it publicly (unrelated to below).  

2.  buy a property in QLD that will be protected.  It's going to be  split into 3 dwellings and then sold on completion. I will be in a sort of partnership with another person (from QLD) who has a trust account already, with a couple of properties in it. I will be buying the new property, the second party will be developing it.  Profits will be split based on percentage of money invested.  If all goes well, we will try and repeat this formula again. 

Neither of us know how to create a joint venture/trust arrangement for this in a trust.  I understand though that the trust agreement needs to be in place before we buy the property or start the business, rather than after.

2,"I work in IT in Chicago.  Have been over in the US for a decade.  
Once you are legally in the US (ie on a work visa), you can do almost everything a citizen can do.  You want to apply for a Social as soon as you arrive, as you need a social (SSN) for almost everything (applying for apartment, some banks want one to open account, etc).  
  
If you will here a few years, I wouldn't be too concerned about sending money home regularly.  It is easier to open bank accounts and manage finances in the US.  You need to declare worldwide money to the US Tax system anyway, so you don't gain much by sending it home.  
  
I recommend finding a month to month furnished rental company for when you arrive.  They are a little more expensive, but life is a lot easier to have a month over here to sort stuff out, and they are much cheaper than hotels.  
  
Just like Oz, so many apartments are rented by private landlords.  Some won't talk to you without credit history, but many will.  They may want a slightly higher security deposit to cover.  If you are renting somewhere like Chicago, the laws are so slanted to the tenants, that you will get any security deposit back unless you trashed a place really badly.  So don't worry too much about paying more security deposit.

Despite your wealth a very simple Will may be all that's required to get the job done properly. Or maybe not. Your lawyer can tell you that. 

Interesting your comments about your Will being contested, as in my experience the grounds upon which Wills are contested aren't guide as broad as what many people are led to believe. You might want to consider in advance just how realistic the chances of having your estate contested are - in particular, who would contest it and on what basis - so that your lawyer can give you the most appropriate advice.

How long you are able to be on claim for should you be unable to go back to work. Often age 65 is good option.

Waiting Period:
How long you have to be off work before you make a claim. Think about your savings, sick leave etc. how long can you support yourself before you'll need your income replaced. Rule of thumb is 30 or 60 dates. Note; IP pays in arrears so on a 30 day wait you'll receive your first monthly payment after 60 days. 

Superannuation Element:
Make sure you have a policy which includes a super contribution element so you dont ruin retirement planning if your on claim for ages. 

Indexation:
Make sure you tick this box. 

Inside/Outside super:
The problem with inside super is that you need to be pretty bad off before you'd get a claim because you also need to meet a condition of release. Outside super often offer much more comprehensive features. Some insuers will have a hybrid product that will take as much as possible from super and charge for the bells and whistles from your personal bank account. I do this with TAL. Called superlink

Level or stepped premiums: 
Premiums can either go up with age and inflation or stay flat (level). Level will cost more initially but save you a mint later on in life. Go level if you are under the age of 40 100%.

* Contents - when I moved out 
* Home - when I bought my first place
* Health - around the time we got married, and before the lifetime loading kicked in

Some people look at insurances and only see value if they 'win' - ie, make more in claims than they pay in premiums. For me, they're a hedge against an outlier (black swan, but not really) event that could ruin all our plans. 

As we achieve financial independence we'll likely start shifting into more 'self insurance' - for example, I won't need income protection when I no longer need an income; when the mortgages are gone, life insurance will be less necessary.

The reason for a rent rise during the crash, is that people who default on their mortgage need to move out and rent a place.  Banks get massively backlogged with repossessed homes they are struggling to sell, so they leave them empty for some time.  This created an actual housing shortage which forces up rents.

I signed up to an overseas trading account to buy NASDAQ-listed shares. I put $5000 AUD in the account, getting me $3500 USD. 

Months later, I bought the NASDAQ shares for $3400 USD, leaving $100USD in the trading account. According to my 2013 copy of Australian Tax Law, this constitutes a Forex Realisation Event 1: I disposed of foreign currency. So I have to calculate the gain/loss on:

$3400 USD converted to AUD at the daily rate when I bought the shares (aka disposed of the currency), less

$3400 USD converted to AUD at the daily rate when I bought the currency. 

Next, I now have $3400 USD worth of shares, which I later sell for $3700USD. This would also be a CGT event, right?  So I have to calculate the AUD value of the shares at the date I bought them (cost base) and sold them (proceeds). Even though I don't get my hands on the money, because the cash is still in USD in the trading account.

Finally, I now have $3700 USD from the sale plus the leftover $100 USD from when I bought the shares, totalling $3800 USD, sitting in the account. When I convert this back to my Australian bank account, I have again disposed of foreign currency, and so have to calculate the gain/loss on:

$3800 USD in AUD when I convert it to AUD (easy enough), less

$3800 USD in AUD... split into $3700 in AUD when I received the share sale proceeds, and $100 in AUD when I originally put money into the account. Is that appropriate? 

I hope the steps make sense. In summary, there is a CGT event when you use USD to buy US shares; when you sell the US shares (even though you don't receive Australian money); and when you convert the US proceeds back to actual Australian dollars. 

In my situation there is enough of a time lag between each of these events to make them distinct CGT events, I'm thinking. 

I'm looking at 22-400 in my old CCH Aus Tax Law guide for the first event, but can't find any additional guidance after that.

Equity/Line of Credit Loans generally have a higher interest rate than standard principal and interest loans. A line of credit loan is basically like a giant credit card secured against your property, and often interest only, and that limit stays available no matter how many times you pay down or re-draw the money for whatever. ",1,0
2,"Hey a few things to note,

LOC are usually a higher interest rate than a basic variable rate loan, but LOC are more flexible. You likely don't need the flexibility on 100% of the balance of the loan, you could consider having LOC for part of the non-deductible portion of your loan (assuming you have some investments which have used borrowings to purchase). I would probably look at no more than 50% of the non-deductible portion of the loan but you would need to consider how fast you are going to be debt recycling, and you starting point etc. So usually you would split your loans

Almost all loans have redraw facilities available, so you are still able to access the additional principal you have paid off to take out to purchase something else. These funds wouldn't be available through your LOC but could be put in an offset account or regular bank account. So as long as your other loan has redraw facilities available, you won't have any issues with accessing equity off either loan you use.
Most people who do debt recycling don't do the purchasing on more than a once a year basis. Doing this means you can structure your loans as follows:

1: Interest only loan (100% deductible) - this loan you will increase each year.

2: Principle and Interest loan (0% deductible), this loan will decrease each year by the amount #1 increases. If not using LOC, this account will may have an offset account to put additional repayments into.

3: LOC - (0% deductible), this will stay the same value each year. 

Each year you will adjust your loan balances to increase the limit on #1 loan to reflect on the amount that has been repaid using #2 and #3, using those funds to purchase further investments. So you can just look at the total interest paid on #1 and that is your tax-deductible portion.

I personally don't think LOC are that useful unless being used for an investment property where you want to manage all cashflow through the account, I would prefer just using an offset account and a loan with redraw facilities. You will likely be paying a package fee to your loan provider anyway as this is often worthwhile when you wish to re-distribute the loan values on a semi-regular basis, as well as holding more than 1 loan product at a time.

I suggest you look into how Offset Accounts work first and also look into how Redraw works.

The place would also get around 15k in renos done by myself but This is a positive for me as I would like a project and to upskill myself. I really love the layout. It’s a two story town house with 2 beds and a court yard.

The price is mid 220’s which is super appealing.

The other place is an apartment in a supposedly nicer area but it is mid 270’s. It’s also a two bedroom place but it’s on the second story with a balcony and it’s one floor so it’s got less internal area and no courtyard.

I am not familiar with this area and have not spent much time there. This place has been renovated 5 years ago but it looks a little cheap to be honest and there is stuff that I would redo, but not as extensively.

I think this second place in the nicer area has more potential for capital gains but it is also 50k more with out factoring any interest.

It is also $1200 more in strata and land fees per year.

My heart is telling me to go with the cheaper place that I like more but my head is telling me the more expensive ones due to it holding value better.

These are both in Perth which has a lul in the housing market as it is. During the Mining boom, the same town houses as the cheaper one was fetching 290-300 in the same condition and the more expensive one in better area was purchased for 340k. So they have both lost similar value.

0,"So when you buy something with a credit card, you have a certain period of time to pay it off before it starts charging you interest. The amount of interest that they charge you once that time is up is the *standard interest rate*

If you use a credit card to get cash out, there's often a fee, because you're pulling money out of your ass. That fee is the *cash advance rate*.

A balance transfer fee is when you have credit card debt, and you pay the debt using another credit card. So essentially, you're transferring the ""balance"" (debt) from one card to another. They charge a fee for that, but if your interest rate on the new card is lower it can be worth it.

Low fee cards are a good idea, but remember that cards with lower fees can have higher interest (not a problem if you're paying it off) and can have shittier rewards. Make sure you find out how much the points on your card are worth. Remember that sometimes they can change the worth of the points over time, and the value of the points depends on what you're buying. According to this, QANTAS points are worth about half a cent, and you get 0.5 points for every dollar you spend with the card. Would the $95 fee be better invested in a savings account? Depends on how much you spend. Better open up Excel

edit: To be clear, yes, you're right. If you pay off your card in full before the interest free period ends, then you won't pay any fees except for the annual fee, yes. ",17,0
1,"I'd really consider whether you want a credit card - generally you have to spend a *lot* to accrue a useful amount of frequent flyer points, so I'd look into whether it's worth it first. You might be better off saving yourself the annual fee and putting that towards flights instead..",9,0
2,"I recently learned that the 'interest free period' doesn't mean X amount of time after purchasing. It is within the statement cycle. So if you had, say, a 55 day interest free period and purchased at the beginning of the statement cycle, you will have the 55 days to pay off the item before being charged interest. If you purchase the item 25 days into the statement cycle, you have 30 days to pay off the purchase before being charged interest. If you were to buy something 5 days before the end of the statement cycle you have to pay it off before then or you will start being charged interest. I am not sure if this will make sense as I only recently learned it at a bank training day for my new job, but it put things in perspective. I will never get a credit card again.

Cash advance is a higher interest rate for withdrawing/transferring funds from the credit card account. This is something you want to avoid as much as possible. 

I have had 2 credit cards in the past and I will not get one ever again, as for someone like me they are too risky. I am a lot smarter with my money than I used to be, but I am saddened by how long it took me to learn. If you are smart with your money and terrified of debt, then perhaps? But in my experience I advise against credit cards as much as possible. Again, only my opinion based on my own experience. You could be fantastic at handling your money and that is a good thing. But confidence can sometimes be a downfall.",6,0
3,"> would not substitute my income unless absolutely necessary

Be super careful about this. It's easy, really easy, to consider your monthly minimum payment when buying new stuff (i.e. it's only $50 more a month! I can afford that!), and that's how you end up paying many, many times more than that item was originally worth to the bank.

To avoid fees - whenever you get a bill, it'll have a 'closing balance' figure. Pay that by the due date. Don't do anything that attracts immediate interest (like take a cash advance).

An easy way to make sure you are staying on top is to group up your savings account and your credit card in your internet banking (if NAB can't group them, just do it in your head). Don't let your actual balance fall under what you owe on the card, even if your balance due (on your bill) is actually lower at that time.

Another common mistake people will make is to think they're ahead when their next paycheck will cover the total balance due (i.e. you pay it off every month, but you don't have the cash when the bill arrives). If something goes wrong (i.e. car breakdown, unexpected travel, etc.), you will find yourself forced to pay less than you owe, and that's a deceptively easy way to start a downward cycle.

In terms of day-to-day use, put the money aside, but don't pay off the card after each purchase. That a) may affect you earning points (I only get points based on my closing balance each month) and, much more importantly, b) may cause the reports that go to credit agencies to show very low use, which won't improve your credit score.

And, finally, what do you want the credit score for? The FF points you will need to work out yourself (i.e. will you make enough to justify any fees); but credit scores aren't generally all that relevant for big purchases (i.e. secured loans for a car, buying a house) - you will have enough history just paying your bills (so don't miss due dates for utilities, phone bills, etc.), and the banks will do due diligence by looking at your finances. Mostly, a good credit score (in Aus) will get you access to unsecured personal loans (like interest free deals - avoid if you can, really carefully manage/read terms if you can't) and non-bank lending (like dealer-provided car loans, which are often really bad deals).",3,0

I bank with NAB and the main reasons I am looking at credit cards is credit history and frequent flyer points as I am in a LDR and have family overseas. A credit card would not substitute my income unless absolutely necessary (I have enough money to sustain myself and an emergency fund + invested assets - I would be using a credit card as if it were a debit card and transferring funds into it regularly). I am uncertain on how credit cards work and what some of the terminology means though. 

What is the ""standard purchase rate"", ""cash advance rate"",  and ""balance transfer fees""?

For example, one of the cards NAB offers is their [Qantas card](https://www.nab.com.au/personal/banking/credit-cards/nab-qantas-rewards-card)

If I were to apply for and obtain this card and use it in place of my visa card, transferring funds regularly (e.g after a purchase), would I be accruing any fees or am I only paying for my purchase?

I understand an annual fee applies and would factor this into whether it is worth it, but $95 annual fees seems to be one of the cheaper options.

If you want a lower risk option, look at Defence Housing. The main issue is that it may be harder to sell during the Defence lease period (usually 12 years); but if you plan to keep it for 15 years then it doesn’t really matter.  Also yields are usually lower - you have to make sure you pick the right one (some yield over 5% gross, but the net yield will be under 4%)

They often have houses in the Wagga area (kapooka) and also quite a lot in Sale (RAAF base east) - plus plenty of other regional areas if you aren’t wedded to Victoria

Obviously capital gains or losses is up to the market, but you can definitely plan your financing with certainty. 

As to the other risks ... I don’t see Wagga as being particularly affected by a price crash in Melbourne or Sydney.

2,"Don’t pay it off. Let’s say you buy 1 property for 250k, you only put $50k of your own money in.

The rent pretty much covers the interest payments.

You can afford to cover $1k per year because you only bought 1 property instead of 2, and for the next 10-20 years your initial $50k investment will be exposed to relatively large upside from the increase in the property from a base of $250k. In fact, every 1% rise in property value is multiplied 5x of your actual investment.

Your downside risks are that interest rates rise and/or you can’t find a tenant and you have greater periods of negative gearing. However negative gearing rules cushion these holding costs because they will be a tax deduction. 

Of course, all your upside is dependant on your eventual exit and property sale, and fundamentally, you should believe your property will at same stage be worth more in the future. But I argue this is a winning strategy because

You are largely in control of timing your exit. Your holding costs are minimised because rent covers interest and any shortfall is discounted with a tax deduction.

My wife and I started dealing with our finances a few years after you (age wise), and have now gotten to the point where we own (part of) our own house. Sure, we have a mortgage, but since we started buckling down, we paid off about $18,000 in car loans, 5-10k in credit cards, her parents, my parents, (totalling about $30k between them), and now the only debt we have left is our mortgage, which is small enough that we can service it without stress. (For the record, we bought a lovely but small unit, so we will eventually be able to change up if/when we want to, once we have paid off more of the capital, but the small initial purchase meant that we aren't paying much in interest). 

Point being, you got this! 

My two pieces of advice would be to read about financial matters, and a good place to start is the Barefoot Investor. His approach is not the only approach, but it's one that worked for us. The second piece of advice would be to think about your superannuation. At 24, any extra contributions you make now will be worth heaps more in the long run, HOWEVER, look at the interest costs of other debts. You are almost certainly better off paying off a credit card than you are putting that same money into super. However, once you have cleared those debts, that's a good time to take stock, and Super is a good place to start.

From your details, it sounds like roughly a 4.68% effective interest rate you are paying, which can be beat in many indexes, but I'd say do your research into passive investing! Whole new world out there for you since you seem interested to learn. 

Furthermore, man,it sounds like you have real goals to improve your life. If you want to do year 11 and 12, i suggest figuring that out asap. You could possibly get a diploma and lead that into uni, which you could get into within the year if you do your research. 

So yeah, get educated about selling your house and what you'd do with that money- then think about how to get into uni. 

The money you get from the house will easily help you out until you finish uni- budget the money you get from the house into different timelines (eg: 300k into passive investments, 200k into savings, 50k into getting your life sorted uni expenses etc).

Right now you have $100. If a can of coke costs $1, you can also express your savings as ""you have 100 cans of coke"".

Inflation can be a hidden issue, because we don't just buy 1 thing with our money (*man cannot live on coke alone*), and official averages rarely reflect our personal situation.

3," Nine Hints for first Home Purchasers

Lift your certainty and your home credit know-how with the accompanying nine hints:

1. Ensure you're really qualified for a home credit.

Before you dig too profoundly into the procedure, watch if you really fit the bill for a home credit. Contact a few loan specialists to get an idea of how much cash you can get. This will give you a sensible comprehension of what (and where) you can really purchase. Experiment with Finder's home advance qualification number cruncher to show signs of improvement thought.

2. Research all your home advance choices.

The home credit market is complicated and aggressive. You have to analyze however many advances as would be prudent with ensure you're getting the correct rate and highlights. You additionally need to comprehend what sorts of home advances are accessible. From variable to settled rate credits, premium just and speculation advances, there are a wide range of sorts of home loans. Finding the kind of advance that matches your necessities is pivotal.

3. Deal with your obligation.

In case you're as of now in the red you may think that its harder to get a home credit affirmed, or you will most likely be unable to get very to such an extent. Spotlight on satisfying any huge obligations you may have before you apply for a home loan, particularly high-interest credits. Consider joining a few obligations into one on the off chance that you can. In any case, take note of that a few obligations, for example, college HECS obligation, are far less disturbing than, say, credit card obligation.

4. Get a decent measured store together.

The more money for your deposit the more you can acquire. What's more, you can apply for loans with lower interest costs. While it's conceivable to apply for a new line of credit with a 5 or 10% deposit, you should pay mortgages protection or insurance in the event that you have not as much as a 20% deposit.

5. Crunch every one of your expenses (and ascertain your concessions).

Home purchasing brings about many amazement costs. Financial plan for removalist costs, stamp obligation, application and enlistment charges and irritation investigation reports. You ought to likewise check whether you're qualified for a first mortgage holders concede or stamp obligation concessions. In case you're qualified, you'll spare a huge number of dollars.

6. Position yourself for progress.

In the event that you've begun to look all starry eyed at a specific property, different purchasers most likely have as well. Having all your printed material and store together, in addition to pre-endorsement places you in a greatly improved position to gobble up your fantasy home when you discover it.

7. Admonition emptor (home purchasers, be careful!).

Envision purchasing an auto without checking the mileage or the brakes, and after that having it separate when you get it. A house is likely the biggest buy you'll ever make, and at last you as the purchaser are in charge of ensuring you're getting a quality property at the cost you're paying. Get building and irritation investigations so you're not stayed with a crumbling, termite-invaded calamity. Look at the nature of the property's fittings and development as well as can be expected. What's more, if there are evident repairs required (and you're OK with that) ensure you get a statement for repairs and figure that your financial plan.

8. Get master help.

There are experts who can assist you with each progression of the home purchasing process. Purchasers specialists can assist you with the entire purchasing process, while a home loan merchant can explore the advance market in the event that you can't. Ensure you have an authorized conveyancer investigate your agreement altogether.

9. Make sense of your home purchasing procedure

On the off chance that you need the simplicity of moving into a home which is as of now finished and liveable then you may think about purchasing a built up home. Purchasing a home which has just been assembled has the benefit of being in a set up territory with set up boulevards, pathways, adjacent parks and, significantly, shops and transport. You could even purchase a more established home and complete a few changes.

On the off chance that you would like to put your own particular stamp on your home from the earliest starting point then you should need to assemble your first home from the beginning. Picking the square and the area, the road and the introduction, picking the arrangement and the developer, at that point picking everything from the doorknobs to the paint hues, the pavers to the blinds and everything in the middle. On the off chance that you are building your own particular home, you should apply for a development credit to draw down on reserves.

That means if Vanguard itself went bust, creditors/liquidators etc don’t have recourse to assets and liabilities of the funds (they are protected). In practice, what is likely to happen is for the funds to be wound up and the net sale proceeds distributed to investors or alternatively a replacement trustee put in place to continue to hold and possibly manage the assets going forwards.

0,"If it *has* to be an app that you can get on your iPhone, the main ones that come to mind are:

- Raiz
- Stockspot
- Clover
- Spaceship
- QuietGrowth

I only use Raiz but I'm fairly certain that all of these apps have robo-advisor features, i.e. you insert your age, salary, risk preference etc. and it will recommend a portfolio for you to go with.

Another robo-advisor is SixPark but they don't have an iPhone app. I also just checked the App Store and another one that comes up is FirstSteps, but it requires $5500 in your account for the fee to drop to 0.275% per year (which likely doesn't include the ETF MER fees) and so this is actually worse than Raiz (which requires $5000 to go to 0.275% (which again doesn't include the ETF MER fees).

I calculated it a while ago and Raiz's fees really aren't that bad as long as you maintain at least $5000 in your account. Last I checked when I compared it to Vanguard's High Growth Fund (which is 0.90% p.a.) it was approximately the same. A lot of people criticise Raiz's fees and say that the fees eat up returns which is true *if* you have a small amount in your account, like $200 (and it's pretty silly to have that kind of amount in any robo-advisor fund I'd say).

I suggest that you look at each of these apps and their PDS and determine which one you like the most (i.e. whether or not the ETFs included and how they are weighted in the portfolios appeals to you, as well as fees etc). [This](https://skilledsmart.com.au/best-investing-apps-robo-advisers-australia/) website has a nice summary of each, but it's best for you to double check the figures. 

As I said I've used Raiz since launch, and I have been contemplating moving away from it simply because 54% of the Aggressive portfolio is made up of STW (the Australian ETF). 

If you can do without an app, a Vanguard retail fund would be highly recommended by many on this subreddit. 

Oh, and in terms of having a split between robo-managed and managing it yourself, I'm not sure if many (if any) of these apps allow you to tweak the ETF weightings a each portfolio, I doubt it though.

0,"Vanguard is the name of the company. They are a managed fund that offer low cost investments in different types of funds.  The funds are normally very low fee because instead of actively managing the investments by shuffling what they own based on specialised (can also be code for expensive) research, they perform 'passive/index' management. Vanguard isn't a get rich quickly scheme if you have any concerns, if anything it's get rich slowly.

In short this means that a fund that invests in Australian Funds they might try and align to the ASX 200 (top 200 australian companies) by buying shares in those in the same proportion that they fit the ASX 200.  So if ANZ makes up 5% of the ASX200 then they'll own approx 5% ANZ shares in the fund. Many will argue that index based investments are better that actively managed funds based on comparing returns over many years now.

They also have funds that try and mirror different international indexes, other investment classes like bonds, or fixed interest - and then on top of that they have funds that combine all of the different funds into a single fund that aims to meet different risk profiles for investors (i.e. high growth, balanced etc.).

You can have a read of more info on the [Vanguard Website](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/) or a community called [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy) (named after Jack Bogle who started Vanguard).

Vanguard have different types of ways of puchasing the funds, which others have alluded to. Basically you can buy directly from Vanguard (inc. using Bpay), or you can buy them through the share-market as an ETF.  They are essentially the same thing, but a different way of buying things.  A little like paying a power bill via bPay vs via credit card vs paying in cash at the post office (the fees can differ and you can pay it through a middle-man if you want).

The advantage of the retail and wholesale versions however is that they allow you to make smaller contributions (minimum $100) via bpay VS having to save up a lump sum and buying a chunk of shares of the ETF however this comes at the cost of a high percentage management fee.

Vanguard retail funds and ETFs make up around 90% of my passive income, so I thought you might be interested in my experience with Vanguard distributions over time, which I wrote about [here](http://www.thefiexplorer.com/2018/09/28/reviewing-the-log-trends-in-passive-income-and-expenses/) and [here going back through my early path to FI](http://www.thefiexplorer.com/2018/09/08/wind-in-the-sails-a-history-of-portfolio-distributions/).

The second gives a long view about how the distributions have grown over time since I first invested in a Vanguard fund back in 2001. 

My advice starting again would be that ETFs are cheaper, if you are making infrequent larger investments via a broker, but the retail funds do allow the flexibility of scheduling smaller regular investments with Bpay. I've been very happy with Vanguard funds and ETFs. 

I'd be a bit cautious about the reduction in diversification involved in heading down a LIC path, or even Vanguard's dividend focused ETF.

https://terryw.com.au/terryw-tax-tips/

For a ppor, this probably isn't an issue as there is no tax benefit. But if you pay into an investment account, then interest on the redraw may or may not be deductible. Depends what you use the redraw money for. 
",24,0
1,"With a redraw account, you are considered to have paid the limit down to the residual balance. 

Example: $500k loan limit. $200k in redraw. Take the $200k out as deposit for next o/o purchase, your repayments will be based on $500k but you only have $300k of deductible debt. 
With an offset it'll be $500k deductible because the limit never moved. ",12,0
2,"I had a long conversation about this very subject with my tax accountant yesterday - borrowing from redraw for deductible vs non-deductible use.

If it's for investment purposes, all good.

If it's for your own benefit (in your case a PPOR deposit), you will now have a non-deductible % of that interest, *until you pay off the loan completely*.

You can't redraw 50k for your PPOR, then drop 50k back into your redraw account and everything is back to normal. No, from the time you redraw for non-deductible purposes until you pay off the loan completely, you will have that same % non-deductible.

eg: Take 50k redraw and your total loan is now 200k, your redraw is 25% of the loan, so now your interest payments are only 75% deductible.

Drop 50k back into the redraw, and it's now 150k loan again. ATO considers this to be paid proportionally, so 75% was for paying off the investment loan, and the other 25% went to paying back your non-deductible part.

The result is that you still can only deduct 75% of the interest from your taxable income.

tl,dr: Only redraw for non-deductible expenses as a last resort.  For deductible loans its fine.

Back to your question - for a PPOR that might become an investment property, a redraw account is fine if you're going to use it for investing again. If it might be for a PPOR, use an offset account.",7,0

Wish I knew this 10 years ago, before I paid off my mortgage on a place I’d love to keep and rent out, but now realistically have to sell when I move. That’s why banks with redraws tend to charge more for loans with offsets, they can, because people can’t just use a redraw.

On the plus side, if you redraw from your PPOR to invest that portion of the interest becomes tax deductible.",3,0

9,"First time poster long time lurker...

I know this question has been asked before but I’ve got a follow up question that I can’t find an answer too. 

An answer I’ve come across often is that if your intention is to ever turn your PPOR into an investment property, then offset is the way to go. I believe this is because you can move the money you have built up in the offset to pay the deposit on your next PPOR, thus leaving a larger interest component to your repayments that are now tax deductible. 

However, if you had a fee free, unlimited redraw, wouldn’t the outcome be the same? You withdraw the money in the redraw to use as the deposit, leaving a larger interest component to your repayments, which are now tax deductible?

I might be missing something obvious here....

1,"The property clock is not a thing. 

It is beyond ridiculous to think this is how markets work. Prices move with supply and demand; when supply is high, prices go down, when supply is low, prices go up. That is the nature of the ""cycle"" you hear about. 

It is a self-feeding cycle, because when prices are high, this tends to generate supply as builders want in on the profits, and inexperienced new investors want to jump on the money train. 

Eventually, that supply exceeds demand (a big factor in this is that construction has a long lag time, so supply in housing is very unresponsive to demand changes), prices stall, and this pushes down investor demand because people won't bid up house prices (driving the profits that attracted investors in the first place) when they can choose from thousands of identical houses at a discount.

The idea this operates in the form of a ""clock"" though is complete nonsense, and one look at Perth and Darwin's roller-coaster rides over the past few years will tell you that. Property markets are often very seasonal, and almost never have smooth, circular trajectories, which means if a city is flat *now* after falling, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to cycle through a growth phase, and if a city is rising now, it doesn't mean it's the start of a new boom.",28,0

Also if you aren't using a food bank you should be. You are literally who they're set up to serve. I'd also talk to Anglicare for some assistance for the next few weeks.

So we'd have several weeks of our regular fees and then all of a sudden get hit with 2-3 weeks of fees and then not pay for another few weeks, and so forth. Fortunately we're in a position where we could kind of roll with it.

Unfortunately, all I can say is that you were right but it always doesn't play out how it's supposed to.

It might be worthwhile opening a second account just for childcare so that if you do overdraw, it's not all of your cash going out at once. It's a nuisance to handle, and you shouldn't have to do it, but it can be a bit of a fallback.

As others have said, check out Anglicare and Salvation Army to see if they can provide an assistance parcel or other support. Contact your utilities to ask for a hardship extension as well. If you feel comfortable doing so, you might want to see if the day care can explain what happened and if they can refund the additional amount.

You might also consider reaching out to a local church or your local maternal health agency to see if they can link you in with some resources. Your state's child protection website might also have a list of orgs. You might also consider looking at any possible niche aspects of your situation and seeking out services that are suited to that (e.g. grants for people returning to work, people leaving domestic violence, disability, single parents, refugee/migrant communities, student parents, etc.) and google something that might apply to you. If nothing else, when you contact one of the big charities keep in mind anything that that might apply to you (and by extension, your child).

If your child is school-aged, then the school's student welfare officer might have some information as well.

At the risk of sounding glib: I'm not sure how old your child is, but it took me until adulthood for it to click that there were times we didn't have much money. Ultimately, kids just remember having loving parents- which it seems you are.

I'd suggest if you are confused about centrelink stuff setting aside a day to either go into an office or call them up and ask them to explain it.

Maybe people would rather sell now then have their holding value drop and then have to pay tax on the extra income?  Also a lot of 'sellers' would just be market makers keeping the unit price in line with the NAV.

1. Why did the unit price fall after an announcement of a larger than usual distribution? On the surface I'd have thought that's desirable behaviour.

2. Why are people selling units of these immediately before the record date? Wouldn't the size of the distribution earned by hanging on to the VAP units for another business day or two offset any losses incurred if you expected the ETF's value to drop by another percent? The distribution is $2.52, but VAP closed $0.82 lower on Friday - if that happened again on Monday and Tuesday (the latter being the record date) you'd still be slightly up.

Years down the track I don't see an issue with this but doing it intentionally early on wouldn't be fair really. I'd just be upfront, tell the adviser you're happy to pay for their service but agree on a fee, have commissions dialled down the nil 30% saving every year and the fee will be made up in the first few years depending on the fee and premium.

I'm working on a website that makes it easier for Australians to search for property and gather insights about the current trends of the property market.

All property listings on Homebrowse are sourced from Domain.

I've just released Homebrowse to the public in closed beta (limited sign ups available). If any of you are actively searching for property to purchase and would like an additional tool to help with your journey, I encourage you to give Homebrowse a try.

With that said, Homebrowse is still very much a work-in-progress (this is the initial beta release after all), so although it may seem feature lacking in some aspects, I will be continuously iterating and adding features that I hope to shape with your feedback.

Michael Kodari fired his bodyguard for insisting on legal advice

Myriam RobinColumnist

Jun 23, 2019 — 8.00pm

We're not sure which of the many things revealed by Steven Tran's lawsuit against his previous employer Michael Kodari is the most Kodari-esque. Is it the fact that Kodari's Chifley-Towers-domiciled KOSEC must be the only business at that address to employ people on award wages (apart, perhaps, from the downstairs cafe)? Or the fact that he expected his bodyguard to protect him from the thuggeries of gossip columnists?

Tran is a martial arts expert with a long career in security. In 2015, he responded to an advertisement to be Kodari's personal bodyguard, his duties initially to accompany Kodari to nightclubs and events for $50 an hour. But from mid-2016, these duties expanded to working as chief operations officer at Kodari's boutique investment firm, a $150,000-a-year role in which he was asked in late 2016 to prepare new employment contracts for KOSEC employees, some of whom were on the award.

As part of this process, Kodari's fatherGeorge was asked to get Tran to sign a new contract. According to Tran's version of events, which prevailed in court despite objections from both members of the Kodari family, he refused to sign anything without having his lawyer look at it. For this intransigence, Tran was fired. Judge Robert Bromwich in Sydney's Federal Court on Friday found that to be a form of adverse action.

Kodari may have already been displeased with Tran, which, it emerges, might have been our fault. You see, around this time, Kodari was mentioned rather uncharitably in this column. The pieces were ultimately retracted and an apology issued. But back in November 2016, Tran suspected he was being blamed for the articles, noting a distinct chilling of Kodari's attitude towards him.

According to a conversation Justice Bromwich accepts as having ""clear logic and a ring of truth to it"", during their discussions about the contract Kodari rounded on Tran for having ""f----d"" him.


""I trusted you,"" Tran deposed Kodari saying. ""You should have stopped Joe Aston. You should have protected me."" To which Tran asked if Kodari was blaming him, receiving the answer: ""I'm blaming you and I am blaming myself.""

""I gave you a Maserati,"" Kodari added. ""I don't care about the Maserati,"" Tran responded.

(And for the record, Tran did return the Maserati, along with a few mobile phone handsets, after Kodari ""caused the police to contact"" Tran at 11.30pm the evening of their disagreement over the contract. The police told Tran he had to return everything by noon the next day.)

For the ordeal, Judge Bromwich ruled that Michael Kodari, George Kodari and KOSEC should pay Tran a total of $151,000 (being six months' pay plus some penalties). Costs are yet to be decided.

Whatever the total bill ends up as, we're sure Kodari can afford it. He's kind of a big deal. He has many leather-bound books and his apartment smells of rich mahogany.

Or so we assumed from the delightful photograph he shared the last time we wrote about him. Nothing screams class louder than gold panthers ...",8,0

We speak to the team behind the most intriguing recent property sale.
The property: A newly built four-bedroom home on 550 sq m with home theatre and basement garaging for 5 cars at 19 Albany Road, Toorak, VIC. Sold by EOI. Price guide was $10.5 million to $11.5 million. Market sources said it sold just under $11 million.  
Who was the agent/agency? Anthony Grimwade, RT Edgar Toorak, who declined to confirm sale price. Vendor: developer Chris Holland.
How long was this on the market? 192 days.

The newly-built 4-bedroom home at 19 Albany Road, Toorak, VIC sold for just under $11 million.   
Why did this one sell? [Anthony] It sold because it was a fantastic beautifully built property in one of Melbourne’s best streets. It had a lot of what buyers are looking for - 3.3-metre-high ceilings, a floor plan that worked well and particularly low maintenance, which was good for the family that ended up buying it. They had older kids in school and the large block of land wasn’t a requirement.

Advertisement
Was it overpriced? This is the second campaign. We had expectations it might have been in that $12 million to $13 million range. We brought the price down when we repositioned it for another EOI campaign. Initially, when we went to market, given that we didn’t receive clear-cut contract at the original price point, it would probably be yes. It was slightly overpitched.
If there were people seeing extraordinary value at the upper end, it would have sold three-four months ago.

There was a greater-than-expected degree of hesitation among buyers, and the conditions they asked for, at a higher price range.  
What did you think it would go for? In that $10 million-plus bracket. 550 sq m is a reasonably small block for a house to be built on. There were properties behind and the side which potentially put some people off.
What was surprising about it?
There has been more caution shown over last six-12 months and that is a result of what you have happening with the banks, APRA and a general slowdown. I was a little bit surprised, I would have thought the $10-million-to-$15 million properties were largely protected, as buyers are not having to rely so heavily on bank finance and funding.
It’s the first time I’ve seen that in quite a long period. Even though the upper end is largely protected, obviously there are people that still need to borrow funds to make purchases at this sort of level.
One offer was conditional on finance. Others were on very long extended settlements. One was conditional on the sale of another property, which hasn’t sold. There were conditions put in which we previously hadn’t seen before. The owners were clear they wanted a straightforward cash transaction.

Advertisement
Wasn't it just the case that the vendor pitched it too high?
It could have been a position that the agents and developer - their optimism was a bit over the market.

Cutting the price guide widened the pool of buyers.  
When the vendor adjusted the quoted price down, it brought a whole spectrum of other buyers back into the market. A lot of buyers, when they see it advertised in the $12 million-to-$13 million-range, don’t even bother to come and inspect. When we had readjusted to $10.5-million-to-$11.5 million, it brought a whole raft of new buyers to the property.
Do you reckon we’ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?
b) Next year. I think we’re going to see a lot more results in this $10-million-to-$15-million range over the next 6-12 months. We’re starting to see more people coming through.
There have been, and still appear to be, other properties in Toorak in that $10-million-to-$15-million range [that] have been there for quite a period of time.

6,"They're not wealthy, that's why.  High income + High outgoings doesn't equal wealth.  If I have a bucket with a hole in it and I fill it with water fast enough that the water line doesn't go down, it might appear at first glance to be a full bucket, but it clearly isn't, and when the income (and credit, they're all tied together) stop, the bucket drains out. 

It happens every cycle, high incomes just mean high access to credit, margin loans, etc, which means outpaced increases in 'net worth' on paper...but when you haven't lived through a market cycle, when the credit crunch comes (and it's always when, not if), these people are over-leveraged, don't exit positions, and watch their asset prices crumble, they go to borrow more credit ... but can't, they fire sale assets or go bankrupt, etc.

Wealthy people have the same access to credit, they either trade with rules (at x % profit, I take my profits and forget about the trade), and they don't over-leverage, they keep capital on the side & have the credit ready to go when the market is bleeding.

Use the dividends and extra repayments to pay your non-deductible debt. Then when you have more equity you redraw more from the same split you used to buy the first shares, so say another $10k. So then you have $20k worth of deductible debt, and your non-deductible debt is continually decreasing. 

If you do it the way you proposed by constantly paying down the $10k portion, you'll only ever be able to deduct interest on the $0-10k remaining in that split, where as if you only pay down the non-deductible portion, eventually your whole remaining balance becomes deductible.

4,"Hi Everyone,

I am interested in debt recycling but I am not entirely sure if I understand the concept too well. 

My partner and I are about to buy a house. We were approved for a loan that allows 4 splits and redraw facility.

I am thinking of making one of the splits 10k, then pay it off with left over savings after paying the house deposit. Then, take out those 10k using the redraw straight to our brokerage account without any 'detours' and buying ETFs. We continue to make extra repayments and dividends  will go back to paying the 10k split, once paid we will redraw rinse and repeat. Eventually the dividends help repay the 10k quicker and allow us to do the process again faster.  Doing this we might benefit from tax deductions for interest paid on loan.


Things I am aware of: 
-Money needs to be for investing only.
- Money from the split has to go directly to brokerage account.
- Personal money should never be mixed with split money 
- The whole amount of money of the split should be used or leave a dollar but not 60/40 as the ATO will not accept it( can't remember why, but I read it)


Can this plan work?
What things do we need to take in consideration to keep the ATO happy?
Does the bank provide statements for interest paid in individual splits?
Lastly, any important considerations for how to split the loan?

7,"I am looking to refinance and would like some opinions. 

Age: 30

Single, no kids or dependants

No car, no loans outside of a credit card which is paid in full every month

Salary: $60,000 + bonus; overtime, last year's frequency was a lot, this year maybe five days

Current mortgage:
30 years (27 left)
Interest rate 3.60% (P&I)
Amount owing $300,000

All I have been told is get the longest period possible and shortest frequency between payments, adding additional payments when possible. After some reading I noticed that a 15 year (P&I) would save me in interest around six figures over the term. I can make those repayments at my 3.60% IR, so this lower rate would be easier. 

Here lies my dilemma, I do not know if I should go for the 30 year loan and make my P&I payments adding the difference I would have paid at a 15 year, or simply get a 15. For the last two months my work has begun to slow - typical this quarter of the year - but a lot more than previous years, overtime is drastically down; big management have told our boss to use it sparingly, so he related the reason to us peons. 

If it all goes belly up and I'm on a 30 year loan, I haven't looked into great detail, I would still be able to afford mortgage payments on the dole. Strata and rates I have not costed in and I do not know if these are assisted by the government. I couldn't do this if I chose a 15 year.

On a 15 year loan I wouldn't be able to 'live' whereas a 30 I could go out now and again over the course of a year and have some fun.

0,"1. Definitely keep a decent emergency fund. I'd probably keep around 10k in a savings account for that purpose.
2. Don't sacrifice everything for investment too early. Yes compound interest is amazing but you should prioritise feeding and educating yourself well first. If you haven't already, have some life experiences like a holiday overseas in a different culture. Don't go overboard though - I've had friends get the travel bug and neglect to save anything until their mid-30s...
3. I wouldn't be contributing extra to super at this point - you're so far off retirement and there are many many many things that might pop up that you'll want the cash for. You'd hate to have to take out a loan to pay for a wedding or something when you've got all your cash tied up in super until 2060...
4. Consider putting part of your savings in RateSetter month-to-month or something like that so you get a slightly higher return but keep it liquid in case you need to use it.
5. For starting to invest in ETFs and with a relatively small amount of savings I'd suggest buying VDHG whenever you have $5,000 to invest. Reason being it's diversified in one fund and therefore reduces the brokerage costs of buying multiple different ETFs.",14,0
1,"1. You have $12,000 in savings. Personally, I'd use $5,000 to invest in an ETF. Vanguard is a good starting point. It all depends what you want to be exposed to! There is plenty of articles/recommendations out there. I went with [VGS](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8212/assetCode=equity/?overview) for my first $5,000 purely because I wanted more International exposure than Australian. It's entirely up to you and what you want to be exposed to.
2. I like to save up $4,000+ portions of money to invest in ETF's and buy at certain intervals (quarterly for me, could be bi-anually for you). You could just save as much as possible in 6 months and invest that - doesn't have to be $4,000+ for yourself. Because you have to pay brokerage per transaction, if you buy many small portions it adds up over time (brokerage varies stockbroker to stockbroker - some are $10, some are $15+ per transaction, etc. - not a percentage of what you buy). If you prefer to deposit regularly then [a Retail Managed Fund might be what you're looking for as you can usually Bpay in deposits whenever you like](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/productType=retail) free of charge. They obviously come with their own pros such as someone will manage allocation for you. The cons are that you pay more fees as a result (usually a percentage of your money invested).
3. I'd use your remaining savings as your emergency fund in a HISA (High Interest Savings Account). You may break your leg and not be able to work. You may need major dental work. Your car might break down. Anything can happen, and I think that $5,000 would be enough for you as an 18 year old. As you get older (and earn more) you might increase it as you may end up having dependents which will need to be accounted for. Most 'experts' advocate for 3 to 6 months of income for an emergency fund, but $5,000 is heaps for you right now. Myself, at 27 years old now, still have a $5,000 emergency that I haven't touched in over 5 years and will help me survive if anything did happen. This will change for me soon as marriage and kids come along!
4. As for saving for a home, and after you've spent $5,000 on an ETF + put $5,000 into an emergency fund, you could use the remaining $2,000 for that and save regularly. You want a 20% deposit in a decade or two? That is years away - I wouldn't be too worried about saving hard for that now if that is your timeline. Plus, as you earn more you will be able to allocate more to this in the future. You can always change this approach if you decide you want it sooner, spend less on ETF's and allocate more to a house deposit fund.
5. I don't salary sacrifice to Super and I'm not knowledgeable enough to give advice - I'd definitely find someone who knows their way around Super to advise you! By the sounds you probably don't earn enough for your tax to be radically reduced anyway.

This is not a refinance in a lenders eyes. You refinance a property with a mortgage in your name and the title in your name.

Since you never technically purchased the property, you would need to purchase the property in an official capacity from the parents, meaning you will need to pay transfer duty, registration fees etc.

Since it's likely you won't pay market value due to the amount you've already paid into the propertyand the house technically not being yours, you'd need to engage a solicitor or conveyancor and get their take on it, then go to your bank lender and explain the situation upfront.

Short answer is no bank will consider this a refinance. You'd also need to settle the house then re-apply for an increase/cash out for renovations.

E: also to the self employed income question - no, borrowing power is borrowing power, just depends whether lenders take lowest of 2 years or the average, you'll need to provide 2 full years of tax returns and most lenders will average, if you have an increase or decrease of more than 20% you'll have to explain the increase/decrease in more detail.",8,0

This has worked great but we're in a position now where we think we're more likely to be approved for our own loan and as we'd like to renovate our bathroom, and interest rates are low, we thought we'd look into refinancing.

We owe about $330k and were thinking an extra $20k for the bathroom so borrowing $350k in total.

I estimate our house is currently worth about $550k (based on sales of similar properties in the area) so we're well under 80% LVR.

I am most interested in UBank at this point as the no frills, no fees, low rate loan suits us fine.

The Ubank website has our borrowing power at $455k based on our current incomes ($42k and $32k).  Is this likely to be affected by our self employed status?

The purpose for the original loan is still intact ie. For funding the purchase of the IP, and nothing has changed on that front. By withdrawing from the offset attached to that loan, you would just be increasing the interest charged to that loan which would still be tax deductible. 

If however, you withdrew using redraw from the original loan, then if you want to maintain tax deductibility, then those particular funds you withdrew need to go towards another IP, shares or some other investment asset.

1,"Firstly, if you borrow money from an IP (which is also what you do when taking money out of a redraw) then if you use that money for something that is not an income-producing asset, then the interest for that money is ***not*** deductible.

First thing to do is check if it's a real offset. Some banks call it an offset but it is really a redraw. If it is a real offset, then the money in there is yours and you can take anything out and everything is fine. If it is actually a redraw, then no the interest is now ***not*** tax deductible on the money that is use for a PPOR since a PPOR is not an income-producing asset. However if you withdraw to buy another income-producing asset like an IP then yes it will be deductible - it depends on what you use the money ***for***, not where the money came from.

From what I've read (there isn't much about this on the ATO website), it appears that so long as the original loan is attached to an income producing expense, all interest should be deductible.

I am looking for people’s opinions - I have been working for about a year now and have managed to save a small amount of money, this money is sitting in a high (2.2%) interest savings account.

Be very careful with bridging finance. The freedom it gives you prior to purchase could end up being very heavy shackles afterwards.. The interest rates are generally higher, and the reason you end up on bridging finance is that you probably can't afford both houses.

Personally i would never buy before selling unless.

1. You can afford both loans for at least 1 year if the old house stays empty and doesn't sell/settlement falls through
2. You don't HAVE to sell your original house. you could instead rent out if required

Not that I suggest using leverage, just that you are not really doing a Dalio portfolio, but an Anthony Robbins bastardisation of it.
2. Long term bonds had an insane tail wind as interest rates came down from 17% to 1% over the last 40-ish years. The result was enormous returns from bonds which are not normal, and won't be repeated since interest rates won't go from 1% to negative 16%
3. Bretton woods was a one time deal, so make sure to exclude that for your return from gold and it no longer looks so amazing (not that I am saying gold is 'bad', just that be careful including a one-time event).

Anyway, if you wanted to implement it - there was an Aus person who posted an ""ok"" version of what is available here but over in the financial independence sub (not the Aus version), and it was something like

* 11% REITs
* 11% Infrastructure
* 15% Aus shares
* 15% global shares
* 30% government bonds

I would not make any major decisions until your baby arrives. Having a child can upheave your life in ways you did not expect.

A two-bedroom home should be fine for one child for a few years. If you have a second child, then you'll start to get a bit crowded once the older child reaches school age, as an estimation. Particularly when the ""sleepover years"" begin! Many families do manage with less space/rooms, but if you have the option to have a bedroom per child, it's a lot more breathing space. Or simply to have a spare room/home office.

I would say that it's fantastic having a bit of garden if you have a kid. You don't need a lot, but some green space is good. We didn't except for the small communal patch out the front of our apartment block right next to the highway and covered with bindis. But fortunately we lived close to grandparents who did, and it really helped. I actually get quite angry about the way new developments are planned these days, often very far from parks with no green space. It's not good for anyone's mental health, adults or children. 

Even a little balcony or verandah is something. My friend used to put a little paddling pool on her balcony for our kids when they were babies.

And if you're being frugal - avoid most of the baby stuff that simply didn't exist 20 years ago.

You don't need a ""rocking chair"" (unless you want one longer term for furniture) to breastfeed.

So it's come to my attention that ACT ambulance charges differ significantly from the remainder of Australia. Not only are the fees higher (Average of around $700 minimum for a call-out, up to ~$1000 for actual transport) but there's fewer options to lower those fees, such as annual ambulance insurance or membership offered by the state. Additionally, while ""Good Samaritan"" clauses protect those who call an ambulance from themselves being charged, there seems to be no clear way to contest a charge for an ambulance called on your behalf, even if consent or genuine need isn't present.

Hope that clears up some of the confusion, I hadn't realised the states had such different situations.

(Also posted in the main Personal Finance subreddit; didn't realise there was an Aus specific sub)

My partner suffers from vasovagal syncope and will pass out after even relatively minor injuries or severe stress.

A couple of times now, including quite recently, she had others call an ambulance for her while she was unconscious.

Despite refusing the ambulance, refusing any kind of treatment and saying that she never consented to an ambulance call, we were still hit with a $1000 charge each time with absolutely no way to dispute it.

I wanted to know if there's any way to stop people ambulance bombing you and forcing you to fork out the cost for their over-reaction.

What makes this particularly frustrating is that the caller in the most recent case was her supervisor at work who is fully aware of her condition, despite knowing the syncope episode was transient and harmless, he still opted to call the ambulance and slap us with a fee for another grand.

We can't afford this, and I don't want it to happen again.

Does anyone have any insight as to how this situation can be avoided short of expressly telling everybody she meets to never call an ambulance? (Which isn't even a full solution as it presents a real danger of a genuine need being ignored and doesn't help when strangers make the call).",17,1

Each month there's a brand new workout promising it's the one that will get you ripped, but what was wrong with last month's workout? They have to keep churning out these articles because it keeps the readers coming back.

That said, in all fairness, this portfolio isn't terrible - much better than my mum's advice of buy Woolworths and my mate who tells me it's all about crypto and weed stocks. But it's probably not optimal.

VAS percentage is probably too high, especially if you already have a good chunk of your superannuation invested into Australian stocks and bonds. Our economy is only something like 2% of global, so you may want more exposure to international companies. Perhaps switch VAS and VGS percentages around.

The companies in IXI are already in VGS - but at a much higher fee of 0.47% instead of 0.18%. I don't think it's necessary to overweight these companies. Even the Motley article states it *might* be a good defensive ETF - not much confidence (or research?) into how they will perform relative to each other in a recession. So I'd scrap this ETF. Put it in VGS instead.

Emerging markets - I wouldn't put any more than 20% in, if you don't feel comfortable you could shave it down to 10% or even 5%. Put the difference in VGS or VAS.

2,"My first recommendation is to buy and read ‘Barefoot investor’. 

If you want some specific advice on where to start, here’s mine (almost all of which is found in the book)

1. Open a savings account with UBank. Put $2000 there and forget it exists. You’ll need this money one day in an emergency. 

2. Even though your have virtually no expenses right now, start splitting up your money into a number of purpose-built accounts. This will be good practice for when you move out of home. 
- Put 20% of your earnings each week into a ‘house deposit’ account. 
- Put 10% of your earnings each week into a ‘savings goal’ account (holiday, laptop, etc.)
- Put 10% of your earnings each week into a ‘splurge’ account (nights out, brunch, video games, whatever) 
- Live off the remaining 60%. 

(While your expenses are as low as they are now, you should be able to live off 10-20%. I’d recommend sending whatever is left at the end of the fortnight to your ‘house deposit’ account). 

3. Don’t fall into the trap of FOMO. It’s fantastic that you’ve got some money to play with, but there’s no need for you to be rushing into trying to invest it right now. Get the basics right and worry about things like investing in a few years once you have a better handle on what your expenses will really look like.",5,0

1. You will, over the long term, make vastly **MORE MONEY** investing. If inflation is 2% and your savings account is giving 2%, you aren't making any real money at all.
2. Savings can't go down. Investments can go **up or down**. They fluctuate. If you can handle the **volatility** emotionally, then invest because... see point one.

If you have a deadline, ie ""I need to buy a house in 1.5 years"" then investing may not be great because you might be unlucky and hit a downturn right when u have to sell.

It should probably be noted how volatile the stock market is too, particularly in the short term. Some investors think they can handle this but end up panic selling in a down market. 

There is always property investment but the yields are so poor in australia you have to speculate on the price to generate any returns. Property is also a much more active investment that requires additional time and effort, whereas shares/etf’s are just set and forget. 

Q2/3 - I’d rather go Vas, Vts + Veu if you’re dead set on having three funds. Vts/Veu is more diversified and much lower cost than your proposed option. I personally go 40/30/30 (vas/vts/veu).

I can’t speak to bonus interest conditions of specific bank accounts but I can help you to make a decision. 

Are you aware that the changes you are looking to make are only netting you around $30 per year with your starting balance of $1500, or $82 with a balance of $4100 after year 1. Keeping that in mind, it’s important that, if you do decide to change bank, you are not spending money that you otherwise would not have, only to satisfy the bonus interest conditions. Doing so would probably cost you more than you gain in interest. 

At this stage in your life, other banking features might be of more interest to you. If your parents or close-family ever send you money, have you considered that being with a bank other than their own likely means you won’t receive their transfers immediately (instead, having to wait a couple days). This might make it harder for them to help you, immediately, in a time of need. Is ApplePay something you would like to use? Only some banks offer it. Have you considered introductory offers? Some banks will offer $50 or $100 to new customers if they open an account and deposit a certain amount. This may be more useful to you than trying to chase the highest interest rate and being forced into achieving the bonus interest conditions. Or as you said, maybe the mobile banking app is important to you.

I am considering whether to set up an ING or ME bank savings and everyday account. I'm worried I won't be able to access the max rate for these accounts and about the functionality of the ME bank app as I've heard it's a bit clunky. 

Just for clarification, are these the only conditions for accessing the max interest rate?

ING: (max rate 1.95%)

at least 5 card purchases on ING debit card each month (I'm, assuming this is referring to the everyday account)

ME: (max rate 2.05%)

3,17 looking to set up a savings account,1,2
0,"Disclaimer: Not a certified accountant. This is guidance only. Do your own research, contact the ATO, your super fund or an accountant if you've got any in depth questions before moving forward.

&#x200B;

1. Either or both. You can make extra contributions before tax through salary sacrifice (concessional contributions) or after tax by transferring it yourself (non-concessional contributions). An advantage of salary sacrificing is getting the tax concession at the time of the contribution. A draw back is that when you go to apply for the FHSS, you can only withdraw up to 85% of your total concessional contributions. Whereas you can withdraw 100% of your non-concessional contributions.
2. Contact your Super company before you start saving to find out. Many do, but it varies and you will need to ask.
3. It takes 5 to 25 business days and it's recommended you apply at the same time you start applying for finance. You'd mention taking out the FHSS to any institution you're intending to borrow from, and that may delay your finance. Declaring it won't negatively affect your borrowing power. $30k through the FHSS is the same as $30k in a saving's account.
4. Really going to stress to go talk to your accountant about this. When contributing you essentially just add the amount of tax withheld to your return, and they continue to assess your total income as normal. There are other additional tax implications if you do eventually withdraw the funds - you've got to note you've accessed the FHSS, declare it as income and detail what tax has been withheld. You absolutely want an accountant to check this.
5. You've got 12 months to use the funds in line with the rules, and can apply for one (I believe) 12 month extension. If you've bought a house, you've got to live in it as a PR for 6 of the first 12 months (varies if you're say building, i.e. your 12 months starts from when it's habitable). If you've not bought a house and used the funds at the end of the period you can either return them, or you can keep them and will incur additional income tax on it (the difference between the 15% concession and your tax bracket). If you return them you're unable to touch them again until preservation age. You'll also no longer be eligible for the FHSS again either way.
6. Optimal path really depends on your own circumstances. Mostly it's just a slight tax break that can give you a little boost towards getting a deposit together, and it won't really vary very much.

Things to also keep in mind:

* The maximum total withdrawal for individuals is $30k. Couples can combine FHSS totals to withdraw $60k combined.
* ~~If you are in a partnership the status of each person as a first home buyer matters. i.e. It doesn't matter if only one of you is accessing the scheme, if the other has already owned property in Australia you can't use the FHSS for that property. Likewise for most FHB schemes and grants.~~ You're individually assessed for the FHSS - but you'll be jointly assessed for most other FHB schemes and grants.
* General advice suggests giving extra time between starting the application process and when you need the funds.
* You don't need to withdraw the entire $30k, but you only get one withdrawal. You can't take $25k out and then access the other $5k later - it'll be locked away until preservation age.
* You can contribute and withdraw a mix of concessional and non-concessional contributions, but remember the 85%/100% limits. Just say you contribute a total of $20k as concessional contributions and $10k as non-concessional contributions. You can only access 85% of the $20k and all of the $10k - for a total of $27k. The other $3k concessional contributions are untouchable and become part of your regular super.
* You can just choose to not touch the funds at all and retain eligibility as long as that's the law. I would suggest thinking about how using the scheme will affect your total superannuation balance - is it more beneficial in the long run to leave it untouched? If these funds are the difference between being able to afford a PR, look seriously at whether that affects your ability to service the mortgage long term and if you need to, talk to a fiduciary.

1,"So my wife and I both used the FHSS this year when we settled on our new home in Dec. I'll try and give some information on how it worked for us. I don't know all the nitty gritty but this might help.

Firstly be aware of the limits per person. Each person can only withdraw 15k/FY to a maximum of 30k. Also your 25k/yr cap to super contributions still applies.

We were lucky in our position we already had $100k sitting in a HISA which was going to be used for a deposit on a house.  So in May/June this year when I learned about the FHSS I immediately dumped $15k into each of our supers and submitted a notice of intent to claim a tax deduction for that amount. Again we were lucky in that we had the money there and even with those contributions we were just under our 25k/yr contribution cap.

When tax time rolled around we waited a few weeks and our superfund data prefilled into the deductions section and all we had to was lodge the return and collect a nice big return. (Works out to be about 2-3k 'profit' because when you make the contribution it gets taxed in super, so you lose a bit and then get a big return).

After June 30 this year I dumped another 15k into both our supers and filed the intent to claim. Next EOFY I'll claim the deductions for both of us again.

So what about when you want the money? This was the part that I struggled to find a lot of information about from people because it's so new, not many people have actually done it and gone through the process.

We were looking for houses from September onwards and found the place we wanted in October I think. Our offer was accepted on the 5th of October. On the same day I went online to the ATO portal and requested a determination for our funds to be released. This is essentially the ATO calculating how much money you can take from super. This was done instantaneously online. It did not take 90 days. I had a confirmation online and then a few days later received a letter in the mail with the same info. It's worth noting you can do your determination at any time, they do expire after a while but then you just need to do another one if that expires, it's not a problem.

Once you have a determination the second part is applying for release of funds. This is where the money comes out of your super and back to your account (via the ATO first). 

I requested the release immediately after signing the contract. This was on the 6th of October and we were advised 15-25 business days to receive the funds (I think). The money was in our account on the 29th of October. So roughly 3 weeks. 

From here the process is standard to buying a house. Worth noting that when applying for finance it's important to include your determination notice in your application so the bank knows you have extra money to supplement your deposit. We didn't have any issues getting approved though.

Once your money is released form super you have 12 months to buy a house. If you don't you can either put it back into super (I think it gets taxed again at 15%) or you will pay 40% tax on all the money come tax time.

Also regarding your tax return after you receive the money. When we lodge our returns next EOFY the $25k will show up as ""income"", however you receive a 30cent tax 'offset' on this amount. So you only get taxed your marginal rate minus 30 cents.

1. You can have your employer contribute directly on your behalf, or you can contribute voluntarily. I know there is a tax ramification on how you do it (ie. Tax already comes out vs. paying it later).

2. Not all companies support FHSS. You have to contact them to confirm.

3. You have to apply to the ATO to get a determination that the Super can release the funds. This can take up to 90 days and you do this *before* needing the funds. You then have a 12 month window to use it. You then take the determination to your Super who will then release the funds on your behalf.

I'd like to take advantage of the FHSS Scheme after reading about it for so long, and I've noticed that there are always repeated threads on this topic asking similar questions. I'd like to create a FAQ that is a comprehensive resource for these questions which I can do as a follow up to this post. I also had some questions of my own so if people would like to leave there questions here (and those in the know answer them) we can hopefully create a comprehensive FAQ that isn't reiterating the same things over and over.

As always, this isn't financial advice, this is discussion and opinion that can point you in the right direction.

**Questions:**

1. Contributing - How can I contribute? Does it have to go through my employer or can I make voluntary contributions through BPAY? Is there an advantage of one over the other?

2. Super - Do all Super companies support FHSS or do I have to contact them to confirm?

3. Super/ATO - What's the process of releasing these funds and how long does this usually take? Do I need to notify them that I'm using FHSS?

4. ATO - How do I claim the Tax deduction if I do my own taxes when depositing and withdrawing? What box would this be if I'm doing this myself?

5. Followup - What do I do if I buy/don't buy a house? Do I have any followup Tax once I've withdrawn?

6. What's the optimal pathway to do the FHSS to get the most out of it?

1,"I used to think the same. 

Gotta use your points wisely with a bit of research but if your dropping thousands of dollars on flights, then build up the points. 

I regret not doing so last year but now have tallied up some 170K on Qantas FF points in last six months using 100K bonus on credit cards, few other insurance signups etc etc. 

Did the sums and could get a free return flight for myself to New Caledonia



I paid off my credit card in full so didn't have to pay interest, but had to pay $225 for annual fee. So all up $225 for return flight to Noumea from Perth - well not  too bad...

(I keep a list of how much I'm paying on fees etc to make these points worth it, and not blowing too much on it etc)",4,0
2,"Yes it's worth it and churning is fairly simple.  Basically you apply for cards that you put your everyday spend on to get the sign-up bonus, pay off card in full and cancel the cards if they're not worth keeping past the first year.

Edit www.pointhacks.com.au breaks it down well, there's really not that much to it.",9,0
3,"At this point many retailers include points cover in their charges so that even if you don’t collect you’re still paying. E.g. Coles, Woollies, credit cards.

QF points are pretty flexible within Australia and to NZ. Good for interstate and quick breaks. Awful value against in store merchandise.",2,0
4,"It is worth it, if your circumstances line up.

I churn through credit cards for the signup bonuses. I will only pay an annual fee when the bonus more than offset this (eg $200 annual fee, $300 refund). I also recommend point hacks, or the Australian frequent flyer board.

My wife and I travel every year, so the points are used. Right now, we're in SE Asia, with return flights paid on points. 60k points and $100 will get you return business class Vietnam to Perth on Singapore Airlines.

QANTAS have huge fees on redemptions that make them almost worthless. My last QANTAS redemption was for RM Williams boots. 

Most points are worth about 1 cent per point. If you treat them as slightly more than worthless ( i.e don't spend more just to earn points, and always pay your balance off each month), you'll be fine.",2,0
5,"Those international flights will add up quickly, especially if they are in business. That might get you to gold straight away, which is really nice as it gives you lounge access and other perks. So definitely sign up for the program.",2,0
6,"I thought of getting into FF points this year as well. Ultimately I decided against it for the following reasons.

I know churning exists and is a good way to accumulate points, but with my personality I just know it would be a detriment to my life. 

I refuse to pay an annual fee on credit cards, which leaves only American Express which will give me FF points, and the rate isnt as good as others, not to mention many stores either dont accept Amex or charge a surcharge for using it, hence any savings made in points would be lost in surcharges.

I am not just me for travel. I am me and my husband. That means double the amount of points advertised as required to buy or upgrade a flight with points. As an example, with the amount we regularly spend on credit card, it would take us 2 and a bit years to save up enough points for only a chance at upgrading to business class for a return trip. 

Not only is it only just a chance to upgrade, it is the slimmest chance as compared to the people with prestige status with frequent flyers, and also airlines like to always keep business class seats free for those who want to pay so in some cases even if there are seats you cant upgrade anyway. And finally, even to have the chance to upgrade using points you have to buy a more expensive economy class ticket, a flexi economy ticket.

All up, I decided it was not worth chasing after ever declining value of points and changing my shopping habits by prefering stores which use frequent flyer points for the chance to upgrade to business ever 2 and a bit years.

Then again, I dont fly for work nor do I have a large credit spend each month.",4,0

1,"Only skimmed so may have misinterpreted however the carry forward only started last year so for each of you can currently only g0 18/19 $25k - other conts + 19/20 $25k - other conts.

I would bet borrowing non-deductible debt to make use of concessional conts. will be a better use of the capacity than borrowing and investing in personal names (assuming investment is like for like). 

Non-deductible borrowings isn't ideal but the 19.5% tax arbitrage (34.5% - 15%) and the fact the borrowed funds are going to be invested tax-friendly in super (sorry, don't get deduction as investment isn't technically for you) would likely make up for the alternative but would model out as isn't exactly a riskless strategy as the assets from the loan are locked away so is riskier if something wild happened and could liquidate as funds will be locked in super until at least 60.

I've modelled it for retirees who often have conflicting goals to pay down their mortgage and save for retirement. No prizes for telling you that not paying down the mortgage (effectively the same as increasing borrowings) and contributing to super will win out most of the time due to above points but obvs wouldn't be the case if decline albeit would have to be big as the initial tax saving gives you a significant buffer.",4,0

3,"Can someone point me to a link describing this scenario , don’t voluntary contributions have to be from income to lower taxable income? Unsure how borrowing and contributing to super would result in said change of tax brackets.",1,0
4,"In our company we haven't been maxing the super cap each year - instead we had been focusing on getting our mortgage down to zero. We got there this year - likely paying more tax than necessary along the way.

Anyway, now I've been looking at retirement planning (still 25 years away) and I'm considering how we can make use of the concessional carry-forward cap to reduce our current year tax liability.

My reading is that we could contribute 100k between us, less the amount paid by the company already (approx 20k over 18/19 and 19/20). 

If I redraw 80k and pay it to Super, we have a corresponding 19/20 reduction in our income which places us both back in the 32.5% bracket.  

I understand that I'll have non-deductible interest to pay on the redraw - but we should be able to pay that off over 3 years @ 4.25%.

On the surface it sounds like we're able to reduce our taxable income by 40% this year and increase our super by 50%.

I must have missed something big here because  it sounds too good to be true. Would anyone care to point out the flaws?

If the company car includes all your registration, insurance, fuel etc. Then it sounds like a great deal, depending on what the limitations are for personal use (e.g. if fuel is included with the car costs, does that include all fuel used for personal use?)

Having said that if you take the allowance you can still make that work for you. Mines 18k/yr and i basically treat it as additional income and don't ""reserve"" it for my car, if that makes sense.

2,"First Job Car Allowance Advice

Hey everyone, I would like to ask for a bit of advice regarding car allowance vs company car. 

Just a bit of background info:
It’s my first job out of uni and I’ve already got a car. The car is a 2007 Civic and I don’t expect the car to depreciate too much in value over the next year or so. Recent car service said everything is in decent condition - no major issues. 

The job includes a 20k car allowance and I am wondering what the best strategy is to save the most I can. I am very good at keeping tabs with kms travelled and already planned on creating a logbook for tax purposes. The job requires me to drive around a lot - sales. If I decide not to take the allowance, it won’t put me down a tax bracket (not sure if this info helps). 

The car they are providing can be used for both work and personal use, so I don’t mind selling my personal car, and all expenses are covered. 

I have no outstanding debts and all I have to pay for is rent. The main goal is to save as much as I can. 

The company is also offering a novated lease, but from what i’ve gathered, this isn’t a great option? Could be completely wrong here. I am not really looking to get a brand new/nice car. I am quite comfortable with my current one. 

Having some input on this with regards to what the best option is would be amazing. 

Hope you all had a great Christmas and happy NY to all!",0,1

0,"You basically have it. The key is that retailers often struggle to connect offline purchases (in store) with an identifiable customer. Unlike online, where customers are identified by online accounts and the like. It's exactly why stores offer loyalty programs - to get data on customers and better target offers.

Further to this, by using this service you will likely be downloading the app onto your phone. This allows merchants to geotarget offers to you since they will know when you are close to their stores.

So the answer is that merchants will pay them to advertise on the service, and in turn, they will sell customer insights to merchants (saying that...here are customers who spend $x per month on physical fitness, for example). So if you are Coles, knowing when customers actually visit the stores and spend is very valuable. Not everyone is using their credit cards or is in their rewards programs. And if a customer is loyal to Woolworths, they can target them with ads to try and convert them - while not wasting money on their existing loyal shoppers.",2,0
1,"Looks similar to Shopback, with the added bonus of tracking your spend.

Per Shopback, the company pays a certain commission to the provider, and that commission is shared with you. It’s a way to target consumers, especially those who are looking to buy/already buying (and therefore easier to confer) and in return offer an effectively ‘year-round’ sale. 

It provides incentive to shop at your store, and imperative to buy, especially when they have ‘sales’.

It works in much the same way as Raiz Rewards. With Shopback, the general cashback hovers around 1-5%, but there are often ‘sales’ where cashbacks can reach up to 30% (often capped at a specific dollar amount).",2,0

3,"Part of it will be data tracking, but likely on a larger scale than just Coles vs Woolies.

The website gives very little information, but it seems to get you to log into Yodlee, so that it can peer into your bank account and automatically spot your qualifying purchases.

I don't quite understand the business model. Are Woolworths happily giving this company 1% commission or something, knowing that a Plastiq customer will preference Woolies over Coles? Or instead, are they paying 1% commission in return for a data share, so they can spot how often I visit Coles as well as Woolies? Or instead, is Woolies a loss-leader, and the more esoteric retailer (the website mentions Katmandu, an outdoor retailer) are paying them?

I don't quite understand the business model - or whether it's a good thing. Thoughts?",2,1

""are full-time, part-time, or long-term casuals (a casual employed on a regular basis for longer than 12 months as at 1 March 2020)""  


To mean, that reads that anyone who was full time, or part time on March 1st is included. Casuals are only included if they've been employed for 12 or more months as of March 1st.

83,"The JobKeeper Payment is a temporary scheme open to businesses impacted by the Coronavirus.   The JobKeeper Payment will also be available to the self-employed.

The JobKeeper Payment will support employers to maintain their connection to their employees, enabling businesses to reactivate operations quickly once the crisis is over.

To take advantage of this latest commitment from the Australian government to counter the economic fallout,[ **please click on ATO web site to register.** ](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/gen/JobKeeper-payment/)

&#x200B;

 At a glance

* $1,500/fortnight job keeper payment
* Applies to full time, part time and  casuals who have been working for a business greater than 12 months
* Payments will flow to employers through the tax system from the  first week of May and backdated
* If staff have been stood down they are still eligible
* To qualify business turnover reduced by 30% or more (or 50% if >$1B)
* Must be employed as at 1 March 2020
* If you have applied for Job seeker you can transition across
* No superannuation guarantee payable on the payment

 

#### How it works

The Government will provide $1,500 per fortnight per employee for up to 6 months.

Employers (including non-for-profits) will be eligible for the subsidy if:

* Their business has a turnover of less than $1 billion, AND their turnover will be reduced by more than 30% relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month); OR
* Their business has a turnover of $1 billion or more, AND their turnover will be reduced by more than 50% relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month); AND
* The business is not subject to the Major Bank Levy.

Employers must elect to participate in the scheme.  To do this, an application can be made to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), together with supporting information demonstrating a downturn in their business.  At the same time, employers must report the number of eligible employees employed by a business on a monthly basis.

Eligible employers will receive the payment for each eligible employee that was on their books on 1 March 2020 and continues to be engaged by that employer – including full-time, part-time, long-term casuals (who have been with their employer for at least the previous 12 months as at 1 March 2020) and stood down employees.  To be eligible, the employee must be –

* An Australian citizen;
* A permanent visa holder;
* A protected special category visa holder;
* A non-protected special category visa holder who has been residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more; or
* A special category (Subclass 444) visa holder.

Eligible employers who have stood down their employees before the commencement of this scheme will be able to participate.  Employees that are re-engaged by a business that was their employer on 1 March 2020 will also be eligible.

***Important*** – where an employee is accessing alternate support through Services Australia because they have been stood down or had their hours reduced, and the employer will be eligible for the JobKeeper Payment, it is the employee’s responsibility to advise Services Australia of their change of circumstances.

 

### What if I have multiple employers?

Only one employer will be eligible to receive the payment.  The employee will need to notify their primary employer

### Self-employed individuals

Self-employed individuals will be eligible to receive the JobKeeper Payment where they have suffered or expect to suffer a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable period a year ago (of at least a month).

### The payment

Eligible employers will be paid $1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee.  This payment must be passed on to eligible employees.

Where employers participate in the scheme, their employees will receive this payment as follows –

* Employee ordinarily receives $1,500 or more in income per fortnight (before tax), they will continue to receive their regular income according to their prevailing workplace arrangements. The JobKeeper Payment will assist their employer to continue operating by subsidising all or part of the income of the employee.
* Employee ordinarily receives less than $1,500 in income per fortnight (before tax), their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax).
* Employee has been stood down, their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax).
* Employee was employed on 1 March 2020, but subsequently ceased employment with their employer, and then has been re-engaged by the same eligible employer, the employee will receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight (before tax).

It is at the employer’s discretion as to whether they pay superannuation on any additional wage because of the JobKeeper Payment.

Payments will be made to the Employer monthly in arrears by the ATO.

The subsidy commences on 30 March 2020, with the first payment to be received by the first week of May 2020.

 

#### Examples of how it will work

### Self-employed

Melissa is a sole trader running a florist.  She does not have employees.  Melissa’s business has been in operation for several years.  The economic downturn due to the Coronavirus has adversely affected Melissa’s business, and she expects that her business turnover will fall by more than 30% compared to a typical month in 2019.

Melissa will be able to apply for the JobKeeper Payment and would receive $1,500 per fortnight (before tax) paid on a monthly basis.

### Worker with multiple jobs

Michelle currently works two permanent part-time jobs, at an art gallery during weekdays, and at the local café on the weekend.  Due to the impact of Coronavirus, the gallery has closed and Michelle has been stood down without pay under the Fair Work Act.  Michelle continues to work at the café delivering take-away orders.

Michelle can only receive the JobKeeper Payment once, from the employer from whom she nominates as her primary employer.  As Michelle only claims the tax free threshold from her job at the art gallery, this will be treated as her nomination of the art gallery as her primary employer.

The art gallery is eligible for the JobKeeper Payment.  The art gallery will pass the JobKeeper Payment on to Michelle, so she will receive $1,500 per fortnight (before tax).  During the application process, the art gallery will notify the ATO that Michelle receives the payment from them.  The art gallery is also required to advise Michelle that she has been nominated to the ATO as an eligible employee to receive the payment.

The café is not eligible to receive the JobKeeper payment for Michelle.  The income that Michelle receives from her job at the café does not change her entitlement to the JobKeeper Payment she receives from the art gallery.

### Employee made redundant after 1 March

Miles worked as a permanent part-time personal trainer at a gym for 6 months and was made redundant on 20 March 2020 in response to the Government directive that gyms close.  Miles was not entitled to a redundancy pay due to his length of service.

In response to the announcement of the JobKeeper Payment, the gym decides they want to re-engage Miles so they are well placed to resume their operations once the Coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

After being made redundant, Miles had registered an intent to claim with Services Australia for access to the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement.  Miles is single, no children and in total he would be eligible to receive $1,124.50 (before tax) per fortnight.

If Miles chooses to be re-hired by the gym, under the JobKeeper Payment he will receive $1,500 a fortnight (before tax) while he is stood down.  Miles will need to advise Services Australia of his income.  He is no longer eligible for the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement as a result of receiving the JobKeeper Payment.

### Employer with 5 employees who all currently get paid more than $1,500 per fortnight

Sara runs a landscaping company, and employs 5 full-time gardeners.  Sara is paying her employees $1,700 per fortnight (before tax).  She expects her turnover will decline by more than 30% over the coming months and that she will either need to lay staff off, or reduce their wages significantly.

As a result of the JobKeeper Payment, Sara will be able to keep employing every gardener, and only needs to pay the $200 wage cost per fortnight (before tax) per employee above the $1,500 per fortnight (before tax) JobKeeper Payment.",164,1

With the exception of the government picking up the bill for the reduced pay, this is the same as a normal ""business going down the toilet"" scenario (""your current role will be made redundant, but we can offer you reduced hours instead"").

I would imagine that for some businesses even $200-300 a fortnight per employee could help to put them under at the moment. That might be something that as an employee you don't have a visual on. They might simply be trying to keep you in your job with whatever is available to them. Or they might be being complete tight-asses. But afaik, they have to prove to the govt. that they've had a certain amount downturn to get the cash for you, so it sounds more likely that they're just trying to keep you in your job. If they NEED employees to work the hours but can't afford to pay staff at  the moment it might just be that they haven't articulated that clearly enough but that they're actually just trying to keep you employed and keep their business going.

Regardless, I would strongly recommend that you have a good think about how much you need that job.   
In the current economy and in to the next year to two years, beyond workplace abuse/unacceptable conditions I personally think you'd be pretty crazy to pack in a job that provides income; even if it's not the amount that you're accustomed to. Ask anyone that was trying to get work during the GFC what their experience was. 

Not. Good.

Try to get some clarity out of them before you go in guns blazing, and make sure you're on a firm footing of providing them with some options (ie. I'm happy to work less hours to justify the wage reduction, or reduced workload etc. etc.). Give them something to work with rather than expecting them to be able to change. They might not be able to and you might get find that they give you the opposite of what you want by sacking you instead. Anyone that can justify enough downturn to get the Jobkeeper's payment for their staff could certainly justify laying someone off entirely if they became too problematic.",-4,0

I suppose if you wanted to get it as close to automated as possible then the equivalent managed fund is the way to go but then you're stuck with the slightly higher MER *and* the buy/sell spreads.

The other interesting question (probably wishful thinking) would be whether it would be possible to do an in specie transfer from the Personal Investor account to the traditional Wholesale account once your balance crossed $100k considering that the beneficiary is likely to remain the same and, unlike transitioning from the retail fund to the wholesale fund, it's the same product on a different platform.

If so, it might make it worth eating the higher fees now (which are still 41 bp lower than the retail fund for the first $50k, then 11 bp for the next $50k) to be able to transition to the lower expense ratio with no CGT event.

2,"Unless I'm wrong, your lease holds sway here as it is a contract between you and the landlord. The new owners can request that you leave, but cannot make you leave. The new owners will have had to know that that you have tenancy here and the end date of same. I sold a unit once that was tenanted and had bought it with the same tenant - there was no mention at any stage of an option to remove the tenant.

If you're on a periodic tenancy,  that would be different. It does not sound like that if you say you have 3.5 months left.

Now, best course of action is to contact your residential tenancy authority. I suspect they're being swamped st the moment with enquiries, so check their webpage as well as be prepared to wait. If you've paid a bond, or have lodged a lease arrangement, they should have a copy of this and can best advise you of your rights.

If you have a copy of your signed lease, even better.

You can voluntarily leave, if you wish, but I suspect the landlord may be trading on your ignorance. If I was in your situation and the landlord wanted me out, I'd put a price for my inconvenience. But the better approach is know your rights, get your documentation together and be courteous but firm. Your buttons are being pushed, so you need a game plan and need to be courteous.

Once your lease is up, you will be out, so you will have to start looking, no matter what.

Best of luck to you. Please note that I am not a lawyer, just giving an opinion on what i would do.


Edit: look at https://www.tenants.org.au/factsheet-28-sale-of-rented-premises

This states that for a fixed term agreement, the buyer must honour the fixed term.

I suppose there is an outside chance the landlord has not advised the new owner that the property is being rented. If that is the case, that would be a whole new kettle of fish. You still cannot be forced out, but I imagine the landlord has breached the terms of the property sale. In that case, it's up to the new owner to fight it out with your landlord.

He will likely have a clause in the contract to sell the property as vacant possession of the premises, but cannot force you with a fixed term agreement in place. If you are on a periodic agreement (ie month to month) then he is within his rights to give you 30 days notice. 

But from what you've said, I do not expect that to be the case.

Investors will depend on how leveraged they are and what they think the future prospects are. It will take 3-12 months before we see the impact there, and then it will be a slow process over years as offsets exhaust etc, property adjusts in price slowly, while investors have tenants the fact that prices have dropped is rather immaterial. So most aren't going to be selling in the next 6 months at least, they can't even kick out tenants. Imagine buying a 'discounted' home with tenants you can't kick out and they won't pay rent?

With interest rates being dropped that actually puts upwards pressure on prices, it's going to be people not being able to rent which will cause a fall in prices (and people not being able to get finance), and some of that at the low end of the property market at least, is being held back by the increased JobSeeker and JobKeeper payments for now....",7,0

Rather than low interest rates decreasing the hurdle rate for investments in the productive economy, it lowers the rental yield required for speculators to service their loans.

You can't pay dividends without cash flow, and while interest is still accruing from loans during the 3-6 month repayment holiday, no cash flow is being generated.

It won't be the environment to capital raise and banks can't just pay out of retained earnings due to APRA capital requirements. Net effect - no dividends.

0,"Hi Mate,

Just wanted to check-in and mention that we're in a similar position with one of our retail businesses. In our cases, it's 9 staff (6 eligible for JobKeeper), and a rental of about $7.5k a month with no communication/deal from the landlord at this stage, just a vague they're ""waiting on announcements"", rent is due tomorrow.  I imagine most are having the same experience.

Our current position is that we have asked CBA for a loan to cover expenses next 6 months  (waiting to hear back) + JobKeeper payments before we get reimbursed by ATO +  a cash buffer for opening again + some related marketing expenses.

My advice would be to chat to your accountant, or if they can't help, find a new one..

However, before you do that, you should know that the government is meant to announce something to do with commercial rentals later on Friday (was meant to be tomorrow but they keep delaying it). They don't want viable businesses to go out of business, so it's likely there will be some subsidy or other assistance provided, so wait for that.

My advice would be to apply for the 250k 50% guaranteed loan, e.g. [https://www.commbank.com.au/latest/coronavirus/business-support.html?ei=cor\_newloan#new](https://www.commbank.com.au/latest/coronavirus/business-support.html?ei=cor_newloan#new)

\- Use it to pay your staff to maximise their entitlements even if stood down.

\- Use it to pay some negotiated rent, once the announcements have been made.

\- Do a budget and work out what/who you need to cut. Accountant will obviously be good for this purpose.

\- Get your Payroll tax refunds, get the PAYG bonus next 6 months (up to 100k), look out for local grants, refunds etc.

It's going to be ok. I have had some bad anxiety the past few weeks as well. We're fortunate to live in a country where we get some assistance to this regard.

Breathe, it'll be ok.

8,"Just a bit of background first. I am a small business operator with 3 store fronts and 2 warehouses. We started in 2018 and were doing reasonably well, and used all our capital to expand to 3 stores in 2019 hiring over 20 employees (all Australian citizens), mix of full time, part time and casuals.

As a non-essential retail business, our trade just dropped by over 80%. Furthermore, many of our staff expressed concern with working in a retail environment during this crisis. We have voluntarily closed our stores to safeguard the employees’ wellbeing. However, our landlords (5 different landlords) have all refused to assist with rental waivers during the time of the shut down. At the same time, we are still liable to pay business insurance premiums and banking loans (payment can be deferred, but fees and interest will just accumulate). These costs will continue to be payable if we are not closed by government mandated shut down. We have now run out of funds to pay anything at all and the stress is taking a toll on me and my family (as well as thousands of others in my situation).

A couple of the landlords have now made offers of 15-20% rent reduction “out of kindness” to “assist us in our time of need”. But to be honest, we can’t afford to pay anything at all with no income. Only one landlord (major shopping centre owner) has told us that they are preparing a new proposal to see us through. No idea what that means yet. They are willing to delay payment by 3-6 months, but how am I supposed to come up with 6 months of rent in 6 months time when I’m making nothing at all? I don’t want to borrow the $250,000 from the bank when I know I won’t be able to pay that back. And it will only cover for half of the rents anyhow.

4 of the 5 landlords has personal guarantees tied to my personal assets such as my house on top of 3 month bank guarantees which also are tied to my personal assets. So in essence, if my business fails and I am unable to pay the rent, my family and I will be in the streets once the 6 month moratorium runs out. So even though I have been on top of all my rental payments and bills in the past and operating what was a successful business, I will most likely end up homeless and broke unless rental payments can be frozen.

We have stood the staff down with their permission as they know we can’t afford to pay them when we’re making 0 income. However, legally we cannot do so unless the gov. enforces the shut down of all non-essential retail. I felt terrible doing it, and my staff have been so supportive which just makes me feel even worse as their employer.

We are relieved for many of our staff that they will now be able to access the JobKeeper payment. However, payment to business owners will not start until May, but we are supposed to start payment to staff now. If we don’t have funds or income, how do we pay our staff unless the payment is passed to us? Don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for them as they all need to pay their rent and cost of living, but I’m still just as helpless right now.

What the gov. is doing now is simply telling consumers to stop going to non-essential stores, and at the same time, telling retail to remain open if we want. It’s a mix message and confusing everyone owning/working in retail. If they make it mandatory for non-essential retail to close, I believe there is a frustration clause which we can use to have many of our ongoing costs (fees, premiums etc) waived. I’ve contacted the Premier and the PM’s office and I’m not getting any answers.

Keep in mind VDHG is made to be an all in one fund and you'd mainly just be buying the same thing and increasing brokerage by adding VGS and VAS to the mix.
Alternatively you choose to go VGS and VAS then you wouldn't buy VDHG as youd have lots of overlap. With only $5,000 you woudlnt go more than 2 funds at most. Keep in mind this should only be if you have a stable income AND have 6 months cash in addition to this, as the worst thing that can happen is an unexpected expense and you'd need to liquidate at a loss (without having time to recover in the market ).

I'd steer clear of VIX, you're chasing returns and you want to look long term.",1,0
5,"Assuming VIX is a joke.. :p

All are completely fine options. VGS is pretty exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, mind, so it may not act as you might expect - I own a good chunk and it’s gone down nowhere near as much as you’d expect because AUD-USD got completely crushed through the downturn. 

Right now I like VAS, as I think we’ve basically got the virus under control here in Aus, and it’s trading at a nice price. Also pleasant psychologically, as it pays decent distributions (doesn’t really matter overall, but something about actually getting payed cash money from owning a share makes it easier to own :p)",1,0
6,"Hold on to it, wait until all of this is over then go to the bank and withdraw everything, then go to the casino.

Jokes aside the key is time horizon. As I'm looking at 7-10 years, daily price fluctuations aren't a major concern (which means I don't really care too much about VIX). I'm looking at the stocks that are undervalued at the moment and assessing whether 1. they are undervalued because of the recent flash sales or 2. there is a legitimate chance they won't recover. 

The ones that i think are the undervalued ones are the ones that i'm investing in. For instance i'm looking at ETHI at the moment, I thought it was undervalued at $11, was buying at that price and it's now 9.50. The major holdings look as if they should be ok coming out of COVID, in fact some will likely grow significantly in the next 2-3 years. There is also the factor with ETHI that it's 'ESG', it's supposed to be an ethical fund which i think will disproportionately affect people's decision making. Especially when it is marketed as the ethical investment option in Commsec Pocket and Raiz which are both platforms designed to bring in newer investors. I fully expect the value of this ETF to be substantially higher in 10 years, even factoring the bear markets. 

But then you can look at something like Virgin, how does COVID affect them in the long run. Probably really badly, consumer confidence for travel will be low for a while, and I can't imagine they'd be able to grow their business much from prior to COVID in the short term, and that's if they were even able to get back to operating at the capacity they were operating at in January. So that's one that even though its price has dropped significantly I won't be investing in. Similar thinking for the Big 4. There are regulatory risks, and competition risks that are going to affect the banks, i haven't done as much research into the big 4 but they aren't really kn the radar.

I'm not one to day trade, and at the moment with so much volatility and irrationality in the market i wouldn't recommend it, wouldn't even bother with VIX.

Personally with the stage I'm at I prefer ETF's simply because it's more of a set and forget type deal, that doesn't require extensive research. And that's where I recommend to start while you learn those research skills",1,0

0,"The government's promised tax cuts may need to be wound back as the nation's finances face what former Reserve Bank of Australia governor Bernie Fraser describes as a ""reckoning"" to deal with an explosion in budget deficits and public sector debt that could reach $1.5 trillion.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has spent $194 billion on stimulus measures to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus, including a $130 billion wage subsidy package announced on Monday. Economists have generally welcomed the response but forecast the government's plan to be net-debt free by 2030 is now highly unlikely, with some MPs resigned to dealing with an ""inter-generational debt"" transfer lasting decades.

Mr Fraser, who was Reserve Bank governor during Australia's last recession in 1991, predicted there would be a ""reckoning"" for a swathe of government policies - including tax cuts - as the economy comes to grips with ""an awful overhang of debt"".

He said the cost of the government's support packages, the equivalent of the entire annual defence, education and health budgets combined, would mean the government would have to re-examine policies it had already legislated.

A new tranche of company tax cuts for firms earning under $50 million starts next financial year, while personal income tax cuts worth $132 billion over a decade begin in 2022-23.

""The packages that have been put together in recent times are very expensive,"" Mr Fraser said. ""There is going to be an awful overhang of debt and at some point there is going to have to be a bit of reckoning with that and some winding back.""

Former prime minister Kevin Rudd said the government had to deliver a budget update by May so decisions about future spending could be debated now.

""That then gives us the real basis for deciding what is needed next, particularly for the long-term repair of the revenue base, which has been the central problem for the Australian budget for a decade,"" he said.

Extra spending this financial year on support measures has already reached $60.8 billion, while in 2020-21 it is expected to exceed $126 billion. The government has also lifted its debt ceiling to $850 billion from $600 billion. Debt currently stands at a record $579 billion. The federal budget faces a huge drop-off in expected tax revenues with corporate, personal income and superannuation taxes all expected to be lower than forecast.

Mr Fraser backed the the government's overall response, saying it had a ""distinct air of fairness"" and it showed the government viewed the workforce and business as ""equal partners in this resurrection"".

UBS analyst George Tharenou, who forecasts the economy to contract by 10 per cent in the June quarter, said every percentage point fall in GDP removes $5 billion out of the budget. A 10 per cent drop in nominal GDP would cost the budget about $50 billion in revenue. That along with the extra spending would turn this year's forecast $5 billion surplus into a deficit of at least $60 billion. Next year's forecast surplus of $6.1 billion would become a deficit of at least $150 billion.

Mr Tharenou said budget deficits by all levels of government would be about $200 billion this year, up from a forecast $50 billion. Next year's deficits could reach $250 billion, the bulk of which would be carried by the federal government.

Total debt among federal, state and local governments is likely to reach $1.5 trillion by the end of 2021. It is currently $1 trillion.

""The size of the increase in the debt stack will be persistent for a very long period of time,"" he said.

Overnight, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg used a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers to urge fellow rich nations to start work now on ways to lead the global recovery once the health crisis was over.

""It must coordinate the lifting of travel, transport and production restrictions, and commit to fiscal actions that will stimulate a rebound in business activity and get people back to work,"" he said.

KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said the government was making a deliberate choice to spend money on behalf of businesses and households to save the economy now.

""While it will take a couple of decades to pay this off, Australia is in a good position because our starting point was strong and the policy measures taken by the government will reduce the economic damage,"" he said.

The world’s largest economy will shrink an annualized 34% in the second quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 24%, economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a report. Unemployment will soar to 15% by mid-year, up from a previous forecast of 9%, they wrote.

The economists, however, now expect a stronger recovery in the third quarter, with gross domestic product expanding 19%.

“Our estimates imply that a bit more than half of the near-term output decline is made up by year-end,” they wrote. While there’s a risk of longer-term fallout on income and spending, the aggressive action by the Federal Reserve and the government should help to contain this.

The new forecasts come days after President Donald Trump extended U.S. “social distancing” guidelines to contain the virus until the of April, abandoning a plan for an earlier end.

Several major U.S. retailers are halting pay for hundreds of thousands of workers as they struggle to cope with the slump in demand caused by measures to control the spread of the pandemic.

1,"Political sentiment in the U.S. has turned so viciously against share buybacks that they may never recover. Some worry stock returns will follow suit. But wagering on the death of American equities has usually been a sucker’s bet.

Always controversial, the sight of companies blowing precious cash on their own shares has become impossible to stand at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is spurring layoffs and raising bankruptcy risk. A lasting death knell may have sounded last week, when President Trump said he didn’t like it when proceeds of his 2017 tax cut were spent this way. Now Congress’s $2 trillion stimulus proposes barring any company receiving a government loan from repurchases until a year after it’s repaid.


It’s a watershed moment for buybacks, a tactic that—while done everywhere—has its fullest expression in American stocks, says Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton. Buybacks by U.S. companies represented 70% of cash returned to shareholders in the 12 months ended June 2019, according to Morgan Stanley. In Europe, where companies ladled out about $100 billion, they accounted for roughly 30%.

The S&P 500’s record of world-beating gains could be the first casualty, Dover says. “Probably going forward there will be regulation, or there will be limits to how much companies can do buybacks and pay dividends, and that will affect how much the market appreciates,” he says. “It could put the United States market on a more even playing field with overseas markets, where buybacks are less prevalent.”

Year-Over-Year Growth in Buybacks of S&P 500 Stocks

Data: Compiled by Bloomberg

Few topics in the market are this contentious. The impact of buybacks on everything from share prices and per-share earnings to the fabric of society are spiritedly debated, with easy answers elusive. On one side are claims that share repurchases brought a huge chunk of gains during the bull market, juicing executive compensation in lieu of investments elsewhere. Opponents say the impact is overstated; using cash to repurchase shares is just a value-neutral exchange of assets from one set of pockets to another, with little ability to increase overall wealth. Moreover, too few shares are bought to affect a market where $90 trillion of stock can trade in a year.

Which version is true has big implications, should buybacks go extinct. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates $700 billion of shares were acquired in 2019 by U.S. companies, making them the biggest net buyer of equities.

A major salvo in the war over repurchases came in a 2017 paper by AQR Capital Management. It found no reason to assume buybacks drove the bull market. Evidence that they result in companies investing less in their businesses is scant, and because they’re often financed by debt, repurchases didn’t use up capital, said the authors, who include billionaire hedge fund manager Cliff Asness. The paper cited academic evidence showing that the announcement of a repurchase drives the associated stock up 1% or 2% on average—not an enormous effect, and one that may be explained in part by the vote of confidence in the company’s future that a buyback signals.

“There’s so many things that go into supply and demand for stocks, and what makes stocks attractive for investors, that viewing buybacks in isolation would miss a lot of the intrinsic value,” says Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. Eliminating buybacks “would make a difference. It would decrease demand for stocks. But if companies are growing earnings and are attractively valued, then there should be plenty demand for stocks.”

Companies with higher buyback yields—that is, those that return more money to shareholders via buybacks—typically perform in line with the market and trail it during times of turbulence, according to Maneesh Deshpande, head of U.S. equity and global equity derivatives strategies at Barclays. “Returning cash to shareholders aggressively makes a company riskier, hence the market rationally does not reward them with higher price performance,” Deshpande wrote in a note to clients. “During downturns these stocks underperform, and this has been starkly true during the current crises.”",3,0
2,"stock buybacks using earnings is not a problem at all. Stock buybacks using debt is a problem in so far as debt being too cheap. The cheap debt is supposed to incentivize re-investment in the company, which would increase business activity. Using this debt as stock buybacks (or dividend payout for that matter) should be something the gov't regulate.

Stock buybacks are more tax efficient than dividend payouts to shareholders, and that's why some companies choose stock buybacks. If a company pays the same in stock buybacks or dividends, the same result happens (capital is returned to shareholders), and yet i don't ever see people clamouring on about dividend paying companies the same way stock buybacks are hated on.

It's an existing property with a tenant in place on a fixed term lease until the end of June. The tenant has indicated they are willing to move out before the lease expires (which we are happy to agree to) but can't/won't give us a date and has also indicated that if we ask them to stay the remainder of the lease they will seek to break lease if they find a new place they like. Our current landlord is not willing to let us transition to a periodic lease, we'd have to sign a new fixed term lease and we can't cover both the rent and mortgage for that period.

We'd like to take out landlords insurance to cover the period from when the property settles to when the lease ends (about a three month period) but with the current situation they all seem to have, quite understandably, stopped taking new policies.

https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2018/pdf/rdp2018-03.pdf

> Zoning regulations provide benefits, but they also restrict housing supply and hence raise prices. This paper quantifies their importance by comparing prices to the marginal costs of supply at different points in time. For detached houses, marginal costs comprise the dwelling structure and the land that other home owners need to forego. Relative to our estimates of these costs, we find that, as of 2016, zoning raised detached house prices 73 per cent above marginal costs in Sydney, 69 per cent in Melbourne, 42 per cent in Brisbane and 54 per cent in Perth. Zoning has also raised the price of apartments well above the marginal cost of supply, especially in Sydney

In the US

https://www.nber.org/papers/w8835

 The price of housing is significantly higher than construction costs only in a limited number of areas, such as California and some eastern cities. In those areas, we argue that high prices have little to do with conventional models with a free market for land. Instead, our evidence suggests that zoning and other land use controls, play the dominant role in making housing expensive.",8,0

Added to that, the larger blocks that older folks own are getting developed into townhouses. And of course, the rise of apartment living is also very common.

The total volume of housing has always been fairly reliable I thought. At least on the Gold Coast, the population hasn't even hit the ""low"" projection by the State Government. As the article states, the number of approvals and planning far exceeds what gets built. I worked on many projects that never got built.

The other thing people gloss over is the fact that wages have stagnated. As well as people on low incomes still think home ownership is a right.

The question is going to be how long can they eat shrinking net interest margins for before their shareholders have to dump them for higher cash flow returns (7% divvies on current valuations are a thing of the past, probably lucky to get 2-3% on current market valuation which isn’t really what the bulk of their shareholders are after as there are plenty of listed firms offering vastly better cash flow returns than this). They will be constrained by the amount of interest buffer they can eat before their shareholders desert them in search of yield not so much how much prices can fall at least in the shorter term. 

In the longer term we’re going to see sustained higher unemployment regardless of what the government does so the rental market is likely to remain weak for a long enough period that the asset rich cash poor older investors will have to seriously consider dumping their properties in search of cash flow to finance their retirement if the fall in rents is sustained. Keep in mind the last election had a huge amount of focus on fully franked dividends which the banks have majorly slashed. I’m not sure there will be an even spread in the fall in prices both in terms of percentages and location but also it only has to be enough to cause a positive feedback loop given the overall weakness in the economy. Like ultimately my family and I own property outright and have cash in the bank so either way we can ride it out given we don’t have debt obligations but also being realistic about the downside there’s a lot that can go wrong from this point. 

The big what if is how far off the risk weighting is. If it’s way off then the capital buffers that are supposedly large kinda don’t matter.

9,">Though a popular metric, permitting intensity does not account for population trends. It is
therefore insufficient to accurately gauge the adequacy of housing supply, especially when cities
are growing rapidly. **A better measure is the excess new dwellings constructed compared to what
would be required by the additional population if they occupied housing with the same number
of people per dwelling as the existing population. ... Assuming the 2.45 persons per dwelling average**,
this reduces private housing demand by 45,000 households, leading to an adjusted total over-
supply at the end of 2018 of approximately 500,000 dwellings.

Doesn't this presume that population growth to Australia on average comes in families more than as individuals? I thought most students and workers came as individuals and therefore to assume they'll be living in a 3 bedroom property might be underestimating how many properties they need to occupy?

If you presume that population trends occupy properties at the Australian average of 2.4 persons per property but they actually occupy them at 1.x as most come and stay in their own 1 or 2 bedroom apartments in Sydney and Melbourne, then you're underestimating how many properties are needed by something like 200-300% as you're assuming single people will mostly be moving into shared accommodation with at least 2 other people, instead of living alone or with 1 housemate rather than 2 or more.

The Australian average of 2.4 is skewed higher because of established families of 3 or more people living in a dwelling. Students and individuals moving to Australia don't live like that.

The biggest problem is the construction industry. It makes up 10% of all employment, it's massive. A large portion of that is employed in the perpetual hamster wheel of property building/rennovation, which requires rising house prices to support it. 

With migration expected to fall in 2020 by 85%, new home and commercial builds can be expected to go with it. If the governement does nothing you can expect both unemployment to rise and housing to fall together in a self reinforcing cycle.

The the government can also take the path of heavily subsidising the building of new homes. This will probably work in the short term, but eventually building mass amounts of homes we don't need will crash the market and will only make things worse in the long term.


Either way they've got a negative feedback loop. Which is why they have taken the middle road of incentivizing renovations on existing homes. But this will not be anywhere near big enough to make any difference if we don't see the return of international students and migrants soon.

My question is quite simple - If the only thing that is keeping the economy from sinking is people spending money to make discretionary purchases or to put it very bluntly, buy things they quite possibly don't need (non-essential) then I'm sorry to say the rot runs deeper. Our economy was in a very precarious situation since much before COVID-19. The virus just expedited the inevitable and this is true not just for Australia but across all of the developed countries in the world. 

The only difference is that we are in a very sticky situation since our economy is not as diversified and quite reliant on population growth (through immigration) which is directly linked to the property prices, higher education via international students and tourism. None of this is happening unless international travel goes back to pre-COVID-19 levels and that is not happening any time soon in my books. 

Although services account for the lion's share of Australia's GDP, I'm not sure where people who've either lost jobs or have had their salary frozen/pay cut/hours reduced going to get the extra money from to support some of these services once the government stimulus runs out?",23,0

My punter view is that when the eviction moratoriums, debt deferrals, job seeker/keeper etc. roll off in September we start seeing some real pain. Not to mention the loss of a staggering number of international students, tourism, immigration etc.

We seem to be all in on a vaccine - otherwise we can't stay locked down forever. COVID is rampant in the US. If no vaccine is forthcoming at some stage we have to open up, but either way could easily see a couple of years of real pain.

Very recently I got word from an ex-employee that they had not been paid a cent into their super, which then prompted me to check mine. NOTHING had gone in since before I began the job in March/April 2019. I made a rough calculation and figured that they owed me roughly $1500-$2000. I sent my boss a message asking what account the superannuation had been paid into, and he replied the next day with a vague ""whatever account you nominated when signing up with us""

2 days after sending that message to my boss, I checked my account again to see if I'd missed anything, and lo and behold! A large sum of $1400ish was deposited into the account.

Capping at 3, you would get 4% of all rental properties being sold off, which would be 86,400 properties. In reality, maybe 2/3rds of that, since that count includes jointly owned properties (effectively double-counting them), so there could be some easy reshuffling of deck chairs. 

For comparison, we build 100k - 250k new dwellings a year. Though, it depends on the geographic distribution of these properties being sold off.

Capping at 2, you'd get a lot more. That sort of thing would certainly cause a crash, with the attendant unemployment and the social ills that come with it.

Discharge fees across the big 4 banks are usually around the 200-300 mark. Smaller lenders, like credit unions and online lenders, can sometimes have discharge fees that are 600-800, and possibly higher.

These lenders are usually the lenders who advertise a low rate to existing customers and then raise rates out of cycle as a way of funding the discount for the next batch of new customers. This is because they know your cost to switch is higher. 

Notwithstanding the fact you've found a fixed rate, I'd be wary of the discharge fee as it will still apply once the loan converts to variable. Personally - I don't entertain lenders with discharge fees above 350 no matter the rate.",2,0

$100k is nowhere near enough for the complex schemes like 'buying a bank' or 'round tripping' at the low end the criminal faces a couple of options which would best be used in combination:

1. Wash it through a casino. Walk in with $5k place some bets and lose some money, cash out $4k. Repeat. Assuming the criminal doesn't want to be caught they should make the pattern hard to spot. Small amounts, irregular sizes, irregular schedule, irregular games, irregular loses, different casinos if possible. Get credit cards and do online betting with multiple providers as well. The objective here is to look like a serial gambler and have a complex mess of finances which are hard to trace. 
2. Wash it through a business. Start a cash based business like lawn mowing, mobile car wash, etc. Actually work in it. Mix in a number of fake transactions which didn't occur, pad a number of real transactions (customer pays a legit $50 but $25 of dodgy cash is added and the revenue recognised is $75) and pay cash for some legit expenses and don't record the cost against the business. The majority of the business income and the majority of transactions should be legit because otherwise it's going to be very obvious. Again use irregular patterns and amounts.
3. Pay some (not all) of their own expenses in cash. Again irregular patterns and amounts.

The idea is:

* Not to be identified for possible laundering; live within the cleaned means, no stupid purchases
* If identified to pass a cursory inspection; the business is real, the gambling is real
* If identified complicate/prolong a more detailed inspection so they give up; appear to be rubbish with finances, avoid patterns have multiple accounts and multiple credit cards with multiple banks, multiple gambling accounts, move money around between accounts changing/splitting/adding amounts along the way etc",1,0

Last I read it'll be optional between stamp duty and land tax rather than a removal of stamp duty.

As far as prices, those with stamp duty saved will add it to their deposit and get a larger loan which pushes prices up on average. 

Secondary to that would be that with more transactions due to less transaction costs (ie no stamp duty restricting purchasers) then all other things being equal volumes of transactions will increase, and as prices follow volume prices further ascend.

Long term I'm less sure, however my first thought will be that there will be the equivalent of negative gearing or some other tax 'loophole' that people with multiple properties can use to minimise impacts of a per-property tax. Removal of stamp duty should see liquidity of the market increase which may increase price volatility as there is significantly less cost involved in transactions, and as a consequence I feel overall prices may soften, but again only slightly. 

As a potential FHB I feel significantly less pressure to find the 'perfect' property (and thus feel less pressure to 'stretch' out of my comfort range), knowing that if I make a mistake I could easily trade up/down without paying a financial penalty in the range of \~$30,000 cash.

However, as a parent, you need to do it for the right reasons.

If the child has a stable career and great prospects for increased income (think early career doctor, engineer etc.) in the near future, a mortgage guarantee can be a great idea.

If the child is bad with money, on a career with little chance for major salary increase or otherwise unstable, it's a bad idea.

I know more stories about the latter. Where children basically bullied their parents into guaranteeing loans that the children could never afford. Citing things like ""don't you love me?"" Things go tits up and parents lose a lot (sometimes their home)

If I have the 13k up front, why is it being added back to the principle of the mortgage? If I’ve got the 13k LMI as a lump sum, why can’t I pay that off as a lump sum and have the 65k as a deposit on the 650k?

> * The day you lodge your income tax return for the year in which the contributions were made

So you need to submit the form (And have your super fund acknowledge it) before you file your FY20 tax, or before EOFY 2021, whichever comes first (Almost certainly filing your tax)

Note that when your fund receives the form, they'll take a 15% slice of the contribution amount as tax (You'll hopefully get more than 15% of a tax deduction on your tax return though)

So you have an opportunity to time the market. Do you think your super investments will go up before you need to submit the form? Then don't submit the form yet.

I will be finishing university at the end of this year and starting my career pathway early 2021 in a graduate program (salary package is $80,000 inclusive of super).

I have always kept my money in a no-to-low interest savings account, not endeavoured into any form of investment and just accumulated little bits of superannuation from internships I had worked at for the past 3 years.

I guess I want to know where te ATO draws the line on the definition of ""genuinely for income-producing purpose"". From general consensus, if you genuinely expect the company/trust/ fund to pay dividends/ distribution but they decide not to, it's still considered an income-producing purpose? However, if you make a conscious decision not to receive income when given the choice (participating in BSP/DSSP, buy gold trust), then you cannot claim the tax-deductible?

""You can claim a deduction for interest charged on money borrowed to buy shares and other related investments that you derive assessable interest or dividend income from.""  


Say I borrow 100k to invest in different companies, some of them pay dividends, some of them are expected to pay dividends in 3-5 years time, and some of them skip dividends this year due to COVID-19, will I still be able to claim the interest payments on the whole 100k portions as tax-deductible or just the portion that invested in companies pays dividends this year.",6,1

My kids are enrolled at a childcare centre whereby we have an account, pay money to them, they deduct their fees and send us a statement each week. This has worked really well, as it means that I can pay them fortnightly for the 2 weeks.

1,"I might be misunderstanding but this sounds like an odd way of calculating your savings rate. Are you saying that if your stock portfolio increases in value this would be captured in your savings rate? This would break down pretty quickly as your portfolio grows and fluctuations become far larger than your income. I would have thought some variant of savings / net income would make more sense for tracking this. Your portfolio value and cash balances can be monitored independently of this. 

I agree that rolling average is a good way of tracking it. 

I calculate my savings rate as (savings + super + hecs pay down) / (net income + super + hecs). I'm paid monthly but I track how much I get paid in a week and how much I spend in a week on standard living expenses (rent, groceries, eating out etc.). A large part of my annual compensation is in a bonus, so I just take (1 - target savings rate) x bonus and put that in a sort of slush fund I use to pay for holidays and other one off items. So in a sense I have already expensed that money when it was received. That way it sort of gives me an underlying savings rate that is a bit smoother, and provided I am not wildly wrong on the target savings rate it should balance out pretty well.

The important thing is to build a system that works for you. Mine works for me but probably wouldn't make sense to anyone else.

The reason organisations like sportclubs etc. keep their funds in HISA's is because they're low risk. Shares, especially in the current climate, pose higher risk.

Were I a member of your club, I would be very distraught to find that a committee member (with little knowledge of shares, mind you) took it upon themselves to invest the whole clubs development fund in shares. I highly doubt your mandate from the club as a committee member, allows you to risk the development fund. This is a football club, not a for profit organisation. That money came directly or indirectly from the club's members (likely some of it from donations), and you have no business playing with it.

In case of a loss, or even lower gains, which is very much possible, the next committee will look at this and assert you took needless risk with/mismanaged the clubs funds.

1," Hello all. Just looking for some advice/feedback  on my plan. Feel free to point out anything I have missed or may not have thought of. I am currently 32 years old if that makes a difference.

So I have some cash at the moment sitting in a HISA which is basically worthless. I feel like I need to diversify or invest and I feel like I have two options:

OPTION A: Wait for a solid dip and buy an investment property in QLD and possibly move into it later in life to escape the bleak freezing winters.

OPTION B: Stocks.

Now I was a property bear, bubble believer, call it what you will for a long time. I have finally come around to the opinion that even if there is a property bubble, it's not going to burst. The property market will never be open. It will always be shielded, tampered with and looked after by the government. I am convinced that they will simply continue kicking the can forever, and build more road if they run out of it.

**So that leaves OPTION B:**

I don't think i'm a particularly greedy person, the only reason I have even begun researching stocks the last couple months is because seeing my interest rate at 1.6-1.8 % has finally encouraged me to diversify. I have looked at individual stocks and to be honest I am the kind of person who could spend forever researching something and never end up pulling the trigger because I missed the rise. I have a few friends who trade individual stocks and the week is a roller coaster for them at the moment, I really don't want to feel like I am checking my portfolio every 82 seconds and I am not sure I want to really put in the hours to feel confident enough to gamble. This attitude has resulted in me looking at index ETFs.

**The plan:**

Based on my attitudes (some may call it laziness) I believe Vanguard high growth may be the best option for me. Not massive gains, hopefully 5%+ per year which I would be happy with considering what i'm currently getting interest rate wise.

Now I know everything is ""Priced in"" at the moment however I am somewhat pessimistic about the future with covid etc. Yes the market has bounced back somewhat but this is not your typical crash scenario. The amount of money flying around in welfare etc is astronomical, a lot of people with little experience (myself included) have decided to just have a go at stocks. This leads me to feel that right now may not be the best time to go dumping my entire savings into VDHG.

I could theoretically get 100k together and invest in Vanguard directly, however the only benefit I found in my research (Please tell me if there are others!!) is that you don't pay brokerage... My understanding is that buying the ETFs is more tax efficient down the line. Saving up decent parcels and buying through self wealth seems to be the go in my situation.

I also understand that being overly cautious and pessimistic could result in me never jumping in and if we don't get another significant drop as I expect I am screwing myself. So the plan is to by VDHG in parcels every couple of months to average down if things do go pear shaped and force me to a plan of investing. I was thinking maybe $15k parcels (would love some feedback on this!) so that way if there is another significant drop like March on any given day I could potentially throw down $30k plus to average down and hopefully buy on a good dip. Lets say I have $100k this would mean I would have my capital invested fully around July next year.

The worst case I can see with this plan is the market crashes right as I invest my final parcel and in that case it's GG and i'll just have to hope I feel like it was a good option given my circumstances 10 or 15 years down the track and It will be providing me some income that I can supplement my lifestyle with and reduce my working hours.

If you have taken the time to read this post thank you. If you think my plan is silly please tell me why as there may be things I haven't thought of. I feel like I am ready to get my ducks in a row so I do have a couple of other questions also:

How long does it take to set up a self wealth account?

How long do transfers take for cash to make it into self wealth?

I don't believe there is any fee HELP available on the foundations. Typically this is something that is covered by your employer, along with the cost of the program. 

Finding a mentor is very easy - they have a searchable database that you can use. Generally most candidates, including myself, just got a mentor from our employer (i.e. a Manager who has completed the program and satisfies the requisites to become a CA mentor). One thing though, and this might just be mine/my colleagues experience with mentors (Big4), they don't do a great deal of 'mentoring'. Its more of an administrative, tick the box role - but would love to hear from other people if they have had a more fulfilling mentor.  

Employment whilst studying should be a given. You're required to perform a number of qualifying hours per week to satisfy the professional experience component of the program, which requires you to be employed for at least 3 years. This may not be required for foundations but I believe its required while you are a provisional member. 

I think it certainly is valuable to pursue given it is a career you are interested in. However, without knowing your circumstances, I'd caution on pursuing it straight out of uni or without employment who will cover the expenses and assist you in qualifying you for the professional experience component. The total cost of the program including foundations can blow out to $10k+ so ideally you'd get your employer to cover this, but understand this is not something all employers will cover.",2,0

Disposing of a motor vehicle to an associate

If you sell or transfer ownership of a motor vehicle to an associate for less than the market value, you must calculate GST as though the vehicle had been sold for its market value.

Example
Sample Pty Ltd sells computers and is registered for GST. The company sells a second hand motor vehicle with a market value of $22,000 to one of the directors for $2,200. Even though the director only paid $2,200, GST must be calculated as though the director paid $22,000.

I don't have the 'market value' of the car in cash so I'm not entirely sure that's possible. I can't seem to get a straight answer from anyone.. Either way, any money the business obtains is going to be coming back to me when I shut it down so it all feels kind of stupid.

The cost base in 2010 was $1000, you are selling them for $3000, so your capital gain is $2000 (3000-1000). If you borrowed money the $1000, and never claimed the interest you can add the interest cost over the years to the cost base, but thats about it.

4,"Hi Adrian

But if a broad question for you.

How did you navigate your career and work out what made you tick. And how did you end up in a position to do that.

I’m currently at a loss career wise - I left my legal practice 12 months ago following the passing of my father and while I’ve tried to find work and had plenty of offers, I’ve found it impossible to pull the trigger because of a mix of trauma related to my prior workplace (who handled my fathers death really poorly and hung me out to dry) and a really strong feeling in the gut that I like to think is instinct telling me to do something else but could be fear of doing it all over again.

Any advice? How do I work it out? How do I balance society’s messed up emphasis on money and expectations about me (and I need to shake them of myself as well) and how do I wake up fulfilled with what my day has in store. People have asked what would I do if I didn’t have to worry about money and honestly - I would do 100 things. I’d go back to uni to learn without any fear of failure or without the goal of finding employment. I would cook amazing meals for friends and family. I’d read. I’d relax. I’d watch tv. I’d game. If I got bored I would do something to alleviate that. But I honestly don’t think I would work.

Again - any advice?",11,0

12,"Hi Adrian,

I'm a low income earner ($40-50k), got no debt, already established an emergency fund in a high interest savings account, invested in ETFs by dollar cost averaging every 4 months, have my finances in order after setting a strict budget, reducing my expenses, meal prepping and following it religiously.

Regarding super and tax strategies, what should more young people be aware about or tax advantage of?

I'm currently learning more about IT skills and have a desire to increase my knowledge in new areas. However, what's preventing me from switching jobs is simply due to job security with the current market.

Thanks for doing this AMA.

I bought and am holding shares of various companies listed on the NASDAQ. In order to buy these shares, I had to exchange AUD into USD. When I sell these shares (considering due to upcoming US elections), I'll likely convert the USD back to AUD.

My question is, if I still these shares now or if i sell them after I've held them for 12 months minimum, how would i go about calculating tax on them? If you can point me to where i can locate this info,  that would be great too.",1,0

For the first few years I rented out the property at a small loss (negative geared) but due to the divorce I dont have the documents to produce a tax return.  I made no income other than the property (rent) which was offset by the Loan, meaning a small loss each year.

The property was sold a few years ago and since then I dont have any income nor deductions, so I want to put in a 0$ return - the problem is if I am missing a loss from earlier years, can I claim that loss whenever I come back to Australia?  If it is only a small amount I may be better just putting in 0$ returns for all the years even though I could carry a small loss forward.

Under my [Mr Taxman](https://www.mrtaxman.com.au/) moniker I run a COVID-19 proof, award-winning accounting practice remotely in Melbourne after learning my craft originally at Deloitte and Pannell Kerr Forster some 30 years ago.

Following the tragic passing of our daughter ~Sophie Cleo~ in 2008, I left practice to spend a decade in academia and was an Associate Professor at Deakin University as the course director for their financial planning programs and the inaugural director of Professional ＆ Executive Education (Domestic) at the Deakin Business School. I am the former chair of the Association of Independently Owned Financial Professionals (AIOFP) and of the Financial Planning Academics Forum (FPAF) and had a [number of research articles](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=tZJOKsIAAAAJ) on audit, tax and superannuation published in some of the world’s top academic journals.

Although I have more letters after my name than the alphabet (B.Bus, CPA, CTA, FCA, FIPA FFA, F Fin, GAICD, MBA, PhD), academia is not something that I am passionate about hence my return to tax & business consulting last year.  In December 2021 I will become the new General Manager of [AFL Masters](http://aflmasters.com.au/), a part-time role that I would be in now if not for COVID19.  This follows a lifetime in the sport including being lucky enough to play in 6 Tests for the Australian AFL Masters team against my family’s native Ireland and I still rub my eyes in getting to play in one EJ Whitten Legends match back in 2009.  I am a GWS Giants fan and a passionate Rabbitoh. A quick Google search & you will find see that my alter ego is one of the [top SuperFans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikxkEj-meww&feature=youtu.be) in world cricket.

My fundraising over the years has seen some fun challenges such as running the Sydney marathon in a leprechaun outfit to growing a big bushy [Beard of Hope](http://www.beardsofhope.com.au/) to [trekking Kokoda](https://www.bearsofhope.org.au/events/kokoda-trek-2020/).

0,"* A share is a little piece of a company.
* The ""price"" of a share (as you might see on Google, say) is the price at which buyers are willing to buy, and sellers are willing to sell. It's constantly moving.
* An exchange (like Nabtrade or Commsec, for example) is a platform where sellers and buyers gather and trade at this price. If someone has said they'll sell a share at $10, and someone has said they want to buy at $10, the exchange triggers a transaction (or trade) between these two. The exchange charges a trading fee to both the buyer and the seller for every trade that goes through.
* An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) - not an EFT, that's a different thing - is a product created by a company (Vanguard, for example) that bundles a bunch of shares into one based on a given set of criterea (an ""index""). For example, an ASX200 ETF is a collection of shares of those companies that have a value in the top 200 of the ASX. When you buy an ETF, you are giving money to the ETF company who agrees to buy these shares on your behalf. From your perspective, you've just bought a single share, from their perspective, they've bought every share in the ETF. The ETF company charges a ""management fee"" while you hold the ETF.
* When you buy shares, you are tying yourself to the fate of the company that you're buying. Because of this, you're taking on some degree of risk; there's always a chance that a company may reduce in value, regardless of how solid it appears. Some companies are more risky, some companies are less risky. Generally it's assumed that high risk offers the chance of greater gains, but also greater losses. Conversely, low risk can minimise both gains and losses. Conventional wisdom suggests that ""diversification"" can lower risk/return. I'll talk about this in a moment.
* Part of investing is in establishing your ""risk profile"". That is, are you willing to risk losing everything for a chance to make it big? Or do you want to (to an extent) protect what money you have and accept small gains? Are you liberal or conservative investor? Just be aware that no investing strategy is a guarantee of gains, it's all gambling with greater or lesser odds.
* A common investing strategy involves ""diversification"", that is, investing in different places so that your losses in some shares are balanced by your gains in other shares, and you come out even. But why diversify if you're only going to come out even? Well, if your diversification is wide enough (you're invested in a lot of companies), in the long term your ""even"" will gradually trend upwards as the entire share market trends upwards. Of course, this requires us to assume that the market will trend upwards over time. This is not certain (nothing is certain), but it's generally considered highly probable in light of the last 100 years of market movement.
* The value of an ETF is that it gives you diversification in only one share. You could either buy one share of an ASX200 ETF, or you could buy 200 individual shares. The former purchase (the ETF) is more cost effective because you'll only attract one trading fee rather than 200. The ETF company charges a management fee, as I mentioned before, but this is generally very small in comparison to trading fees. For example, Vanguard's ASX200 ETF is only 0.10% of the total amount of that ETF that you own.
* You've mentioned Commsec Pocket and Raiz. As I understand it, both are basically platforms designed to simplify the process of buying shares for people that find traditional exchanges intimidating; the trading fees are lower for small trades, and the actual market place (where buyers and sellers come together) is hidden. The trade off being that you can only choose from a small list of ETFs for purchase, you don't have fine grain control over the price at which you purchase these ETFs, and the trading fees are actually higher in the long term.

That's all that comes to mind as to the basics, though I'm sure I've missed plenty.

As a last thought; you've mentioned that you just want to be told what to do. Trust me, I know that feeling! It's easy to look at older investors and assume that there's a *best* strategy, and you'll be set if you can find it. The fact is, there's no universal *best*, or *optimal*, when it comes to speculation. I'd recommend that you try to work out what you want, what you need, and what you believe, and build a strategy that's best for you. You'll need to do plenty of research to work this all out, but I promise it'll be worth it in that it'll make life seem a whole lot more manageable.

I hope this is helpful, feel free to ask questions if you need.

There's a lot of crossover between them so if you decide to go for more than one ETF, have a look at the holdings. There's some currency fluctuation risk with all of them except SYI and IOZ.


Look at the management fees - Raiz charges $2.50 a month for balances under $10k, which is quite pricey for lower balances. You'll also pay brokerage every time you buy and sell with Pocket on top of ETF management fees (although it's very cheap - $2 for trades under $1000). Fees add up over time.

Most professional services firms will charge you for every thing you do from phone calls to emails. 

If you're not sure whether they're worth it then ask for a breakdown in costs and the corresponding timesheets and the billing rates of each employee.

They really shouldn't have billed you without talking to you about it and I can't imagine why they're charging your $275 for changing the registered office. It's literally just going online to complete a form so if somebody is billing an hour to do that then you should really ask why that is.",6,0

4,"As an accountant that charges ASIC out of pocket fees to my clients, the fee breakdown looks normal to me and is probably within the contractual terms and conditions. I would ask your accountant what the fees are and for what purpose. I would also ask to obtain the invoice for the ASIC fee for confirmation. Chances are the fees are legitimate and are: 
1. Fee paid to ASIC to update your company's registered office address in ASIC's registrar
2. Fee paid to ASIC to the change company secretary name in ASIC's registrar
3. Fee paid to perform an ASIC search to confirm your company details and to enable the above. Basically like a police check to ensure everything on ASIC's registrar is correct and up to date
4. Not sure what this.",2,0
5,"What's the fee breakdown? If you didn't have a company secretary (I think that's the role, or maybe it's the something or other agent) registered with ASIC, then their annual fee might not have been sent to you, but instead maybe to your old accountants. And then, if you're late, it doubles, and then after a month it triples. And then, after that, and only after that, they send you a letter. And you go, ""Huh, I must have missed the first two bills, silly me,"" but those bills were never sent, and your old accountant is sitting there, giggling. 

Not that I'm bitter or anything. 

But the point is, is there a fee breakdown? Because it could just all be the ASIC fee. Or maybe the new accountant goofed and forgot to register themselves as the agent, and the above happened and it's their fault, so they're trying to recover that same fee. Anyway, I'm sure this doesn't help, but the breakdown might illuminate things a little bit. The ASIC fee is a thing, and it would be something like a half or at least a quarter of the total.

Edit:

You do need to pay for service, most likely the accountant you were seeing before was undercharging people and therefore flooded with work and your new accountant charges market rate or above market rate so therefore can make time for new clients and return phone calls. Obviously I have made gross assumptions based on very limited information.

The fees themselves would not be that much, maybe $100-200 for all the things that they did. What you are paying for is an accountant's time usually billed out at $100 or more per hour.  Did they do 4 hours worth of work? impossible to tell and again if you dispute it you fall into the category of clients they don't want to keep.

I was with an accountant in Sydney for years, they were doing my personal and company tax returns but whenever I needed some basic advice regarding my business accounting they would take literally months to get back to me with an answer. For example, how much can I pay myself as a director in dividends at the end of the financial year - this type of question would be too hard for them to answer.

A few months ago, I decided to look for an alternative accountant and I spoke to a few and eventually chose one in the hope that they would provide me with a better service and allow me to contact from time to time if I had a basic question regarding my small business accounts. 

Anyway, long story short, we agreed on a fee for the company tax return and they also advised it would include any phone calls throughout the year for basic advice.

I haven't needed them yet, because I haven't lodged my company or tax return for the last financial year, however, today I received an email from them welcoming me to their business and they attached a nice little invoice with it. Over $600 in fact, which was for:  


1. Changing the registered office
2. Appointing myself as the secretary of my own company (apparently I wasn't appointed as the secretary)
3. Searching the ASIC Register
4. ASIC Fee

My question to you - Is this practice normal? Is the fee being charged normal? Or am I being slugged? I never knew about this fee or what needed to be done until receiving the invoice for work which I am assuming has already been done.

I'm all for paying for something but I think as a client I should be notified what they need to do and how much it costs prior to doing it.

So I sent them the dash cam footage and they immediately overturned the decision and let me make a successful claim against the other vehicle.

I am applying for a Child care subsidy (CCS) for my son to attend child care.

We have 2 children. 

My wife takes care full-time for both of our children. Since our newborn needs more attention we want to send our elder one (2 yr old) to Childcare to get him to learn something and give some rest to my wife.

The CCS form has a work test section which I am trying to fill in for my wife.

The closest option for a work test that matches with my wife current work is


*Caring for a child or adult, with a disability

I am not sure if this the correct option for that my wife spends all her time taking care of a newborn. The word disability confuses me. Can this option be used for a child who is not disabled?

This would be correct. Party donations allow political influence to be brought with wealth, and undermine the “one person-one vote” idea that is fundamental to democracy. 

However I will suggest you go one step further and ask what function parties themselves have in democracy. You’ll find that the existence of parties on their own undermines democracy. 

Parties around the world are generally not a part of how democracy was intended to be set up. Very few countries have parties entrenched in democracy law.  They rise out of the natural political advantage alliances give. 

As parties are not normally part of the system, they aren’t included in the original anti corruption laws. By the time anti corruption laws get written for political parties, parties are in power and writing the laws. As such they aren’t going to cut off their own funding.",2,0

I am now a little scared to chuck 5K into my vanguard wallet... Anywho that's not the question. There are like.. 30 different ETFs and Managed funds, what's the difference? How do I know which to invest in? Do I take their % return numbers at face value? Why do some not have 10year outlooks, are they new and risker? Any guidance would be great.

Thanks",2,1

0,"Hi, 

Due to COVID, premium increases were delayed by 6 months by my health insurance provider. I want to prepay my health insurance but not sure whether to pay for a year or half a year. To me it makes sense to pay for half a year since the premiums will increase next March but if I pay for an entire year, does that mean the rest just gets used as ""credit""?",1,1
0,"Notes: 

I thought I would share these cute graphs of my spending and income this year. 

I was unemployed before C*vid hit and received Jobseeker the whole year. Each of the four jobs I got this year lasted less than eight weeks, as they were temporary gigs. 

Expenses such as Spotify have been counted as ""entertainment""; prepaid mobile bills counted as ""utilities"". 

The income category ""gifts/refunds/tax returns"" includes a $1291 tax return and a surprise $850 refund from Flight Centre for travel insurance purchased a few years back that was never used. 

The spending category ""transport"" includes rego, car repairs, petrol, public transport and staff parking. 

My rent was only $160/wk but I paid $100/wk extra rent for about a quarter as I was living in two places at once for work. The total also includes two bond payments. 

I spent a lot more on health this year. I had Bupa extras -- although I was able to put payments on pause for 6 months -- and once I restarted my membership I used it on physio, chiro, a hearing test, and new glasses (which only cost $60 out of pocket including the eye test). 

One of my 2020 resolutions was to pay off my debts: $650 to a friend, $750 to a family member, and about $490 in SPER fines from the transport department. By paying the govt debt through Centrelink, sending my friend $50 amounts when I could, and using the Flight Centre refund, I was able to pay off all my debts this year. So at least I got something done. 

I had hoped to make more money from my hobbies this year, but with everything that happened I just didn't feel enough pride in them. Hopefully next year will afford me more motivation, optimism and opportunities in that regard.

My savings are very similar to what they were at the start of the year, and I spent most of this year hovering between a net worth of $4k and $1.5k. Around the time I had to pay rego and car repairs and pay to fix a friend's car in the same week was the only time savings dipped below 1k. 

Goals for next year include making more money from hobbies, shopping and eating out less, and accruing a new HECS debt :)

1,"You don’t necessarily need to get into the finance or course related clubs to put on your resume. If you got into a presidency/treasury position in say a video games or outdoors club that is still quite valuable to show on a resume. From my experience employers like to see people that get involved in clubs that aren’t just about coursework, so having hobbies is good to put down.

It also might not sound great, but working at McDonald’s is not bad at all, and it is good to show working in one job for an extended period of time. Try to push towards a management/team leadership position before your time at uni is up as that shows a different set of skills to just being a team member. This may actually be more valuable than something like customer service in a bank, because it shows that you can be management material.

The main thing you should focus on going forward is vacation programs for penultimate year students. They are offered by basically every major firm and are effectively a job audition. That’s the main way in to grad jobs, but there are also a lot of them on the open market in your final year.

Your WAM is not as bad as you think, but increasing it won’t hurt. A WAM over 70 should pass the cutoff almost everywhere, but obviously getting not up helps a bit.",7,0
2,"I studied law at university which is similarly competitive for jobs at top tier firms. My university ran a session each year prior to clerkship applications open and the biggest thing they stressed was being well rounded and having accomplishments across the board, both inside and outside university. 

These sessions highlighted that we needed:
- good grades (65+ WAM as a general minimum guide); 
- work experience (didn’t necessarily need to be in law, they even used the example that experience at Macca’s shows you can work as a team. Even better if you can get a management position);
- volunteering (inside uni with different clubs, it didn’t matter if it was law related, but it did help. I know our law society looked for volunteers for running competitions and events, even if you’re not on the actual club leadership team get involved that way. They also recommended something outside university to show you’re diversifying, I managed to get involved with the women’s legal service after a few rejections so keep persevering and help volunteer as a one off with these sorts of places if you can to get your name out there and recognised); 
- Extracurriculars (our law society ran mooting, client interview/witness, paper writing and negotiation competitions, I set myself a goal of at least one of these a semester as a good way to fill the resume and gain some more experience); and 
- sports or other similar team hobbies (they want to see you’re a team player and also are able to work well with others). 

Ultimately by doing a combo of these things (in addition to getting your grades up) you can point to real examples on your resume that you can manage your time to perform well in university, are driven to develop yourself professionally, work cohesively in a team environment and that you’re a very well rounded individual. Being essentially the whole package and knowing how to sell that experience to firms (start doing some research on transferable skills) even if you don’t necessarily have industry experience is usually looked upon favourably. If you can highlight the transferable skills you have and sell yourself to these firms to show you are exactly what they’re looking for is so valuable. The best thing about learning all this now is that you have time to build your resume and keep pushing to improve. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, completing your first year at a Go8 uni with a 70~WAM is an achievement you should be proud of, even if you do think you have room to improve.

Once i landed the internship i demonstrated that uni grades didn’t mean everything, where curiosity and eagerness to learn in the “real” world was far more important and that certainly paid off as i was able to land a full time role at the firm.

10,"I know I'm late but a 70 WAM won't necessarily hold you back. From experience, I was scraping a credit after my first year but have gotten a grad role in consulting. I have also had interviews from multiple BBIBs. I'll be honest, I think your chances are better if you are female. If this is the case, try to attend some of the pre-internship networking programmes hosted by some of these companies. Ultimately, the key to bettering your chances is in taking initiative such as volunteering as mentioned by others. These experiences can then help you shape your cover letter to express your passion about a certain industry which if well executed, can highly increase your chances. Finally, don't underestimate the power of networking. Your university of student societies will probably have networking events but I highly recommend applying to be paired with a mentor in the industry in which you are interested in. Learning more about the industry, what your mentor's role encompasses and building connections within the industry (especially if they are in managerial positions) can definitely have some sway upon decision making within the firm.",1,0
11,"I’ve just finished my first year at UniMelb studying a Bachelor’s of Commerce, majoring in Economics and Finance. I have trash grades (~70 WAM) and essentially have zero ECs as I didn’t get into any clubs or societies. Because of this, I barely had a chance to network.

I’ve read countless posts on here asking for advice about pursuing IB and other prestigious finance roles straight away post uni. The most common answers are to study at a Go8 uni and maintain an 85 WAM throughout the course, as well as network and join as many clubs/case competitions as possible. 

Clearly, my accomplishments do not meet such requirements. So I just wanted to be realistic and consider what finance job prospects I have post uni.

I’ve come to realise there’s no point dwelling on the past, so what’s the most important thing I can do right now? I’ve enrolled in computing related electives and am considering taking an online course in Java/Python as I’ve heard it’s useful for finance graduates. I’ve also started listening to the Money Cafe and am considering purchasing a subscription to the AFR if it’s worth it.

As for clubs and societies, I have no work experience aside from working at McDonalds for the past 9 months, which I realise doesn’t really add much to my resume. Because of this, I’m unsure if any half decent finance clubs will consider me. I am currently looking at other jobs more into customer service, from which I’m hoping to eventually move to a entry level position at a bank to work part time during uni studies.

1) if you buy and sell at a profit the amount of the profit is halved if you've owned for over a year and then that number is added onto your taxable income (things like brokerage reduce your profit)  


e.g. if your marginal tax rate is 34.5% and you buy $10 000 in shares and hold it for over a year and then sell it for $30 000 you've made a capital gain of $20 000. Half of this number is added to your taxable income which means you pay 34.5% of $10 000 in tax i.e. $3450

Are you on  the $20.xx an hour or the rotating day shift rate $32.xx or the night shift $35.xx rate? It states on what you have listed that all allowances have been included, which would be shift allowances, overtime reading that. 

Normally casual is a 25% uplift from the base rate. By the look of it they are paying a 50% uplift on the minimum rate for day shift and a 75% uplift for night shift. 

Is your workplace covered by a site EBA? With those uplifts it looks like it is or else everyone would be paid $20.xx plus allowances, shift penalties. Not inclusive.",3,0
1,"It is a 52% loading above the award , most likely it will cover all your entitlement i.e. sick leave annual leave, penalty rates and overtime.

Basically someone said if you worked every public holiday for double time and a half, you would make 15 standard days work of work i.e. an extra 5.8 percent a year. They did with with all the loadings possible.

Most standard entitlements add up to about 20-25% extra on top of the base. This is why standard casual loading is 25% to make up for that.

The other 27% comes from other things on top of your entitlements like penalty rates and overtime rates.

You could manually work out all the hours based on a 25% casual loading. And if it falls below the award . But at a 20$ base rate it is very unlikely .

This is what will happen if you raise the issue. HR will need to compare what you would have made under the award vs what you would have made under the contract over the disputed period. If there is a shortfall they will reimburse you the difference. Note this takes a lot of time to figure out especially with all the penalty rates you may be entitled to, plus going through all the timesheets etc . 

Maybe you get $1 K back and a higher day/night rate or maybe you get nothing because everything was calculated properly , but suddenly you won't be asked to do anymore shifts because you cost too much in terms of hourly rate and all the time you cost HR to calculate this. It took one HR person 20-30 hours to go through previous timesheets and previous awards etc to find out a pay dispute from one worker I was managing.

If I were you I would go through the award figure out what the minimum you should have been paid , then decide if there is a difference and if the difference is worth potentially losing the job over.",2,0

2,"G'day all,

My partner and I have recently become first time parents, and are now looking at how to be smarter with our money going forward. Overall, we're reasonably young and in a pretty good financial position; very healthy super, manageable debt (car and house only), >$110k in our offset, roughly $200k household income (earned at approx. 50/50 between my wife and I). We're pretty smart with money on a day-to-day basis, but complete amateurs when it comes to investing. We're certainly not looking for strict financial advise per se, but would appreciate some guidance and thoughts on a couple of points to get us heading in the right direction (please keep in mind that we are newbies at this so would appreciate a bit of explanation for alternatives).

For our child, we're considering the 'AMP All Growth' investment bond at $100-$150 a month, which is considered the aggressive option by AMP. I know investment bonds can be a polarising topic and have become extremely popular in recent years. I'd like to know thoughts for and against them given our current financial setup. If anyone has other recommendations (either bonds or absolutely anything else), I'd be very keen to hear them. Points we're looking for are:
- Decent performance balanced with simplicity/autonomy i.e. not a huge amount of continued effort for my partner and I
- Oversight of fund performance and a user friendly interface

For ourselves, we have roughly $100k in our offset which is protecting us from our 3% interest rate on our home loan. For now, we're pretty happy that this is a simple strategy saving us money in the long run. However, we'd be keen on investing anywhere from 10-20% of that somewhere else as a bit of a slow-burn money maker. We don't have a huge amount of spare time so somewhat of a 'set-and-forget' strategy would work really well, providing performance is decent and we have the ability to monitor our investment. Is Raiz considered a good first-stop for beginning to understand the share market? Or would it be worth putting in the time/effort researching other means, or just straight up paying someone else to invest money on our behalf?

A payment plan it the ATO doesn't put you on a blacklist or increase likelihood of an audit.

The only way you would have issues with an ATO plan is if you continually default - if you do, the ATO start to ask more questions s when setting up new ones (will ask for evidence you have capacity to pay). If you just continually default and never pay anything, that's when the ATO will chase (debt collectors, garnishee notice and what not).

The ATO will charge interest but you can apply for it to be remitted once your debt is paid - while it's not guaranteed you will get it refunded without a decent reason you had to delay payment, sometimes you can strike gold and they just do remit the interest without reason.

13,"Hello netizens of AusFinance! I come here seeking a bit of advice on a small predicament.

I participate in a company share scheme which added around $80,000 to my taxable income in the past year. These are vested shares in my possession which I can sell at any stage. That, along with a small income from an overseas fund that I transferred over, resulted in me owing the ATO around $40,000 for the previous FY. Youch.

I imagine most people don't live their lives with 40 grand in liquid cash ready to be paid out. With this tax return looming, I wanted to see how other people here deal with their tax liabilities, especially when higher than their steady state.

Options (in order of least interest paid to a third party):

1. Arrange a payment plan with the ATO
2. Personal loan from a bank
3. Liquidate assets (refinance home, sell shares)
4. Sell fully paid out new car purchased to serve me for 7-10 years and buy a secondhand Toyota 🤮

I'm capable of calculating which option is more worthwhile from an interest point of view. I'd like to ask if there are any extra repercussions when doing any of the above.

Does negotiating with the ATO put you on some kind of blacklist for people not being able to pay off their tax liabilities? Does it increase my chances of being audited or being put on a plan like Pay As You Go (PAYG)? (Note: one could wonder why I don't want to go on PAYG as it would have prevented this problem in the first place. Answer: my income for last year was abnormally high and I don't want to pay towards a projected income that I won't have next year and have money work for the ATO's bank accounts rather than mine).

I recently put an offer through for a property that I was interested in (~450k property, 20% deposit ready to go) and the real estate agent asked for details of my broker to which I replied I have not used one and have gone straight to a lender. 

Fast forward the next few days and the real estate agent has sent me the offer contract which I’ve signed and reverted back to him. Again he asked for details of my broker and again I told him I have gone straight to a lender and also emailed him a screenshot from tictoc clarifying that my application is being processed. 

He then messages me on several occasions to ask if my offer is my very best offer (also throwing in the fact that they’ve received multiple offers) and to again, ask for contact details of my broker. 

Finally, he gives me a call to say that my offer is not acceptable because I have not engaged with a broker and therefore is not confident that my loan would be approved. Isn’t that the whole point of having a subject to finance clause in the offer contract? 

He’s emailed me back the offer contract with a ‘The vendor has sighted this offer but unable to accept’. 

My question therefore is do I absolutely NEED to have used a broker? And are there also any implications to the offer contract that that he’s sent back to me?

Currently paying about 1.35% in margin interest rate, and my total LVR is about 20% so I'm pretty comfortable with my current risk profile and chance of margin call.

0,"Your broker should be giving you advice on the accounts, but a financial adviser or tax accountant could be helpful for some bits as well given your specific considerations.

Notwithstanding that:

1a) You can go part-fixed and part-variable, and use the offset on the variable part if you want.

1b) If the rent covers P&I then you're already positively geared. It's your call. Money in an offset means lower interest so your repayments are higher (note that because the interest is lower, your taxable income is higher\*). 

1c) That said, it's usually a good idea to HAVE an offset - to take the CBA example, if you get the wealth package, the $395 fee usually gets a slightly lower interest rate - on a 415k loan, 0.1%pa discount pays for the package, so at least for the time being it's worth it even with no cash in there. 

A little while ago, CBA were doing 0.7%pa discount on standard variable for investment loans with the package, though I don't know how that interacts with the discount you're already getting on the standard variable. 

1d) If your emergency fund HISA gets a higher rate than your home loan, fantastic. If not, you may want to consider setting up an offset account for the HISA.

2a) Redraw just involves putting money into the loan with the ability to draw it down. The main tax implication (at a very simplified level) is that because you've paid off a bit more of the loan, you get charged less interest, so your rent - outgoings is higher and you have higher taxable income hence pay more tax. You're paying more tax because you're making more profit, so I'm not actually sure this is a bad thing (but see my point in \*).

The difference between a redraw and an offset is that in a redraw the money is sitting IN the loan, and you can apply to take it out afterwards. An offset has the money sitting in a SEPARATE bank account, but it offsets the loan. In both case, the amount you put in effectively reduces the interest accruing on the loan.

An offset is in my view better in that in the unlikely event things go pear-shaped for the bank, money in a redraw is considered money paid into the loan, whilst money in an offset is considered separate. It tends to be administratively easier to get money out of an offset.

2b) Ultimately it depends on whether you can get a higher return elsewhere than the loan. Most people saying 'avoid putting your own money in' are thinking about (for instance) buying multiple IPs and adding leverage. This will depend on your own circumstances.

3) Do you have a better alternate use for the money, basically. I guess worst case you could put the money into an offset account instead of paying down the principal on the loan, which gives you the benefits of the paydown without actually having the money in the loan. This depends on your personal objectives and your financial situation.

4) One thing I've not mentioned in the above is that if the property is only a year old, then you get depreciation as well to offset against taxable income (I hope you're claiming it on your tax!) so my comments about 'lower interest = higher taxable income' get mitigated a bit.

\*Personally I don't think this matters as taxable income being higher because your actual profit is higher is always a good thing in my book. That said, you may feel otherwise and if you have a higher-returning option for the money (shares, another IP, etc) then it makes more sense to do that rather than put money in an offset or redraw. If VDHG is earning 5%, you'd rather pay tax on 5% return than on 3.4% return, is what it boils down to.",2,0

4,"Hi everyone, I’m keen to get some opinions and advice on my current loan for my investment property. 

I bought land and built an investment property a year ago. My mortgage broker set me up with an investment loan from Commbank, and I’m paying a rate of 3.4% on a $415k loan (i know my rate is high). Rental income just covers my monthly repayments (P&I). No option for offset with my loan, only redraw (which I’ve avoided as I’ve read that there are some tax implications around it). I have no intent of using this house as my PPOR, it will be an IP only. I estimate I have around $120k equity on the place. 

I guess I’m wanting to know:

1. is there a home loan out there that will enable me to have an offset account and fix a lower interest rate? Should I even be seeking an offset for my loan? My current emergency fund is about $15k and sits in a HISA, rest of my money goes to ETFs (VDHG).

2. Should I be putting my money into redraw or continuing to avoid it? Is it best to avoid putting in your own capital as much as possible with an IP?

3. Should I be paying interest only, or continuing with P&I? I currently pay slightly above the minimum monthly repayments

4. Any other general advice around my situation as I’m not an expert on home loans (and new to it!) but am continually trying to learn.

Much appreciated :)",1,1

0,I would be looking at the monthly/annual fees to compare the both. Variable rate after the fixed term can be managed by looking for better deals before the end of fixed term period. It may aslo be worth comparing features that you may find useful.,6,0

2,"Personally I’d be fixing for longer than 2 years. But otherwise I’d just choose the lowest fixed rate and refinance if negotiating doesn’t work on expiry of the fixed rate.

Also, don’t pay attention to comparison rates when considering fixed rates.",2,0
3,"We have the option between these two packages for a home we have just had an offer accepted on. Macquarie have approved the loan unconditionally, however if we would like to, our broker can organise the loan with CBA instead. 

Two package options:

Macquarie is 2.09% fixed for 2 years, then 2.54% variable after that. CBA is 1.89% fixed for 2 years, then a ridiculous 3.85% variable after that. 

Am I right in assuming that the variable rate after the fixed term is over, can just be re-negotiated into another fixed term? Does this mean if we DIDN'T want to lock it into another fixed term for whatever reason, then we are stuck with that specific variable rate from then on? 

The difference for us in repayments between the two options for the first 2 years of the fixed term is $50pm.

0,Speak to an accountant but if you have paid down the loan then only the remaining balance  would ultimately be tax deductible. It’s not going to make a huge difference though in the scheme of things. Remember it’s the use of the funds that determine tax deductibility so that’s why an offset account is handy as you’re not actually paying off the loan,3,0
1,"Basically any interest incurred on the $75k already in your redraw once it is an IP will not be deductible for tax purposes. So you can think of your tax deductible loan balance as your current scheduled balance less the amount in redraw (i.e. net balance)

You don't need to do anything right now but don't put anything more into the redraw. When it becomes an IP, I would refinance and get the loan split into two - your tax deductible portion (i.e. the lower balance) and the $75k as a separate split. You can then take out the $75k available and put this in a linked offset account so that loan split is essentially interest free.

If you aren't sure then check with an accountant.

Note: I'm not a financial adviser or accountant, just some random guy on the internet",2,0
2,"Making extra repayments into the account (with redraw facility) is fine, as long as you have made no redraws. 

If no redraws have been made, you can just start claiming the interest portion of the loan, doesn't matter that 75k is sitting in redraw. If you decide to access the 75k in the future, just redraw it, then create a 75k split preferably with offset attached and put the 75k in there. If you want to use this 75k for another investment, pay it back into the new split and then redraw to offset again.

If you have redrawn money in the past for personal use, I have an excel sheet that works out the correct portion of deductible vs non deductible, so you are claiming the correct amount. And then you could leave it as is and just claim the correct amount  or split the loans according to the portions which I think is better. Let me know if you want the calculator.",1,0

2,"Very glad for both of you.

$50K in savings is great - but will add the Q on how long this took? $50K over 12 months is a little different to $50K that takes 3 years. Your lender will very likely want to know this (and will check) when they check loan serviceability. 

In the last 12 months, we've stepped up our savings rate. My wife saved around $50K in 4 years (and I had squat) but in the last year we've saved $60K+.

Your lender will also consider any rent you have paid as ""savings"" too. Sure, it isn't put into an account you control, but when paying a mortgage those funds will assist your serviceability.
