From the finance side, I would never buy an in print rare for $20, just ask all the people who got burned by Hangarback Walker (which is played in more than Standard).

The best in print rares are cards that will see play in other formats, and lately the most recent case of that has been the fetches. Polluted Delta is the best fetch from KTK in terms of universal use and it's still selling for like $15-16 right now. There is no way Westvale Abbey will end up costing more than Polluted Delta longterm.

There's two problems with the $20 price point. The first problem is that we haven't seen the supply actually hit the market. There's going to be a massive surge in supply in two weeks, and that's going to create a ton of downward pressure on every card in the set. 

The second problem is playability. This isn't like cavern of souls, where it can shoehorn into any deck running creatures.

44,2.0,"The real sweet spot to pick up cards was last summer when the yen was extremely weak. We're now back to around 110 yen per dollar from the 2015 125 yen per dollar. 

That being said, I know it's impossible to go back in time and maximize your friend's money. 

Japanese stores know that Japanese cards/foils are more expensive than their English counterparts. As such, they will price it accordingly. To make things worse, trading is not allowed at big stores such as Hareruya (and I believe Yellow Submarine, not sure).

""Do I just get him a list of the 500 most expensive cards since Urza's Legacy and have him start sucking up Japanese foils of those?"" Pretty bad idea. In fact, you could probably find cheaper japanese foils of those cards on Ebay rather than through the stores. Your friend is going to have to really dig through the small stores of Akihabara that don't regularly check their prices to find any real deals and the time invested in that will not be worth it. 

""Sealed Product?"" Not recommended either. I thought this was a decent idea myself back when I visited Japan. I bought a few boxes of khans and origins thinking I could bring it back to the states with me. After all, booster boxes were $83 and I could realistically sell them for $120 right? Well, when you consider shipping, it automatically loses you money. Not only do you have to ship it to the states from Japan internationally, you also have to send it out to your buyer in the states. All in all, I found out that it lost me money and just took it back home with me to draft with my friends (have to mention that it took up a shit ton of my luggage weight)

""Get him a list of Legacy and EDH staples and tell him to look for foils of those?"" While I'm not so sure about Legacy staples, I think this is the best idea. EDH is not the super popular casual format like it is here. This results in EDH-only cards being priced rather cheaply. I remember buying Minamo, School at water's edge (a $25 card) for 1300 yen (about $11) on Hareruya. I don't have too much information regarding Legacy but I do know that Legacy is a thriving format in Japan so I would expect the cards to be priced pretty high.

113,5.0,"I know the thread asks about EMN, but right now you would be better off trying to spec from OGW/SOI than from preorders.  

Preorder prices are always inflated, and for every Jace VP there are 9 Day's Undoing. Sure, a couple cards are going to spike from their preorder price, but trying to pick against these odds is not a sound financial decision. Remember that these preorder prices are mostly set by large retailers such as SCG, who have had many years of experience evaluating and pricing cards. If they set the preorder price of a card to be 5$, you better believe that they are pricing it in such a way to maximize their profit.  

The reason why I would suggest looking at cards from OGW/SOI is because they are at a relative low point during their standard tenure. OGW/BFZ aren't being opened in Limited anymore, and SOI will soon only be opened as a 1x. Even if you whiff on a spec from these sets, you still are unlikely to suffer a huge devaluation until rotation.  

However, the best place to spec right now is on Modern cards with low print runs that can ride the hype train after something gets spoiled. This is far more difficult to do, but the profits are real. Yesterday Allosaurus Rider was a bulk rare that was sitting as low as it would likely ever get. Today it is sitting in double digits because a new card was spoiled, the hype train blew its fucking top, and everybody raced to attempt to make a profit. All on a combo that is very likely to be unplayable.  

TLDR: Unless you are the Warren Buffet of preorder specs, it is not financially advisable to buy into preorders. For maximum profit, find cheap, low print Modern cards that can now see hype due to new spoilers. ",0.37581867,0.46759164,0.1565897,2.0,0.0

I'm wondering what everyone's take on the long term value of Eldrazi cards are -- namely Thought-knot / Reality Smasher -- both of which are archetype staples in Legacy/Modern. To a lesser extent, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, Mimic and Endless One that also appear in Modern/Legacy to a still significant degree.

To me, Reality Smasher at $4 is severely underpriced and Thought-knot at ~$7 is also very underpriced. I feel like the other Eldrazi staples are underpriced as well, namely Endless one, Mimic, Reshaper, even Endbringer.

Just wondering what will happen to their card value upon rotation in ~ a year since they see significant play outside of standard.

Just because your digital Tarmogoyf once held a price tag of 50, does not mean it will always be so. The price tag of non-redeemable staples is heavily driven by constructed demand. If the incentives to play in constructed leagues disappear, these cards will begin to lose value.

If the new changes to MTGO go through, the economy will have to adjust to the fact that your cards are always in print, and that events have prohibitive amounts of rake.

I can't blame constructed players for wanting to sell out of MTGO right now. I don't think it's a terrible decision given the direction the program is going",0.5053923,0.43464595,0.059961688,15.0,0.0
153,1.0,"Today is an especially poor day to start investing in Modern staples on MTGO.  The writing on the wall seems clear to me: MTGO will, in the long-term, move from its current model to one more similar to Hearthstone and other CCGs.  They are very actively working toward the goal of divorcing the online economy from the paper one-- they have significantly reduced the redemption window, they have set it up so that redemption windows do not overlap but rather end at the same time, and have shifted the prize support from paying you in redeemable cards to paying you more in non-redeemable cards.  It is rather likely that within a couple years, they will end redemption entirely.  As a redemption window closes and a new set releases, they will simply announce that the new set wont be available for redemption and that will be that.

I think all of these modern cards will lose 90%+ of their value in this transition-- WotC has no reason not to 'reprint' them as prizes en masse if it means that they can get away with offering fewer redeemable cards as prizes.  In fact, if the complaints about ""treasure chests = cutting prize support"" find any traction with WotC, expect them to respond by *increasing* reprints of these older cards, sweetening the deal so to speak by offering more Force of Wills in your chests.  And people will not cry for the guy holding on to 100 copies of two-dollar Tarmogoyfs because in the new model they'll have two-dollar online drafts (not to mention two-dollar Goyfs for their Jund deck).

It might be a good idea to buy legacy/modern staples. They will rebound if they fix this shit show, but if they wont ai predict mtgo crashing as we know it.

Its a consumer confidence issue (rather a newfound lack of) not a seasonal issue. People dont trust MTGO or the retention of value in MTGO due to these proze support changes that were just unveiled.

Im pretty confident wizards will learn from this but nor for a while. People dont forget shady things like this very easily.

The question I have is, how has expeditions, and how will the masterpiece series effect redemption value? I'm only interested in cards like Kalitas, Gideon, Oath of Nissa, that are actually playable.

Expeditions have little value online, so more of the set value is focused on BFZ/OGW cards, so the ratio of BFZ and OGW from online to paper is much worse than in other sets historically.

The same effect will happen in KLD, with the added new rule of only redemptions when it is the valid draft format.

First, with the liquidity of markets (which includes paper, though it is not as quick to change as MTGO), the price can find a low before the supple hits, as the market anticipates the incoming supply.  

Second, I believe that with chase card in particular, there are significant numbers of players that have been waiting to buy in.

What I recommend doing is trading it into a retailer, online or otherwise.

* SOI brought in a handful of playable zombies and I'm expecting AKH doing the same. Between discard in SOI, revolt in AER and cycling in AKH I think there's a chance of a 6 month window in standard where zombies/graveyard shenanigans could be a thing. 

* Zombie tribal is a perennial favourite in casual, commander and occasionally sees a rogue brew post results in legacy or modern. 

In short, I think there's a slim chance zombies could break through briefly as a real tier deck in standard, and a VERY slim chance zombie players could get some nice surprises in AKH that makes it more viable in eternal formats. Even if that doesn't come to pass I think kitchen table demand might still buoy prices to the extent that I don't take a total bath (though I'd be more likely to tuck them away for a few years and hope for another zombie bonanza set in any case).

The goal with these last two is to play them on your opponent's turn to put them behind, either by tapping their lands before they draw a card, or countering their spells. [[Faerie Tauntings]] works with this plan, and lets you deal some extra damage, so play 2-3. A couple [[Latchkey Faerie]] and the Miscreants help you keep drawing more faeries, as well as a few [[Peppersmoke]].

[[Quickling]] can help you save your creatures if your opponent is trying to kill them. A lot of them do something when they enter play so Quickling helps you get multiple effects. However, it kinda puts your faerie count behind, so just run like 2 of them. [[Faerie Imposter]] kinda does the same thing, but at 1 mana.

For the spells, try to get your hands on 3-4 each of [[Vapor Snag]], [[Mana Leak]], [[Doomblade]]. Finally, run about 20-ish lands, between 4 [[Dimir Guildgate]], a bunch of Islands, some Swamps, maybe an [[Evolving Wilds]] or three. Your friends can help you flesh out the rest of it.

Dominaria will have a significant Legendary theme. 
We already know that Karn, Teferi and Jhoria are in the set. 
Thanks to PAX, we also have the art reveal that showed us Jaya and Linessa.  Linessa especially could hint that we'll see some of the other ""Granduer"" legends in new forms as well. 
Knowing nothing else about the set, we have 5 legends, with the potential of another 4 more. 

Plus, we potentially have art of Venser's Skyship, and the most recent art leak was along with the phrase ""Gather Legends"". 

Going further, if I had to guess on the set's planeswalkers, it will be Karn, Ajani (Remember, he went to Dominaria instead of being an idiot) and Jaya, with Jaya and Karn getting Planeswalker deck versions. (Red and Colorless- while the decks have been 2 color, the walkers have been 1.)

And now for the big crazy one:
Dominaria will have legendary dual lands with some other wrinkle that makes them not violate ""the spirit of the reserved list"".  
This gives them an excuse to not reprint fetchlands in Standard for the next two years, throws EDH players a major bone, and really won't hurt standard in any way. Modern does get another fetchable set of duals and does take away some slots for shocklands, but should actually play well alongside them- most decks only run 2-3 shocks anyways, they'd probably move to 1 shock, 1 legendary, and then either 1 more shock or off-color legendary. 

Plus, it gives some access to legacy. People that have duals would maybe play 1 alongside their normal duals, but it gives some access to players with NO duals.

575,3.0,"My responses:  

1. That's putting a big step of faith on Wizards. 2017 was a year where there were quite a few misses in terms of supplementary products (The Starter Set comes to mind-just watch the Professor's video to see why it's bad). I prefer to just stick to buying singles, being a veteran Standard player myself.  
2. Agree with you on the sealed booster boxes-there's still a huge glut to get over since Unstable and the holiday doldrums took a lot of wind out of their sails. Some Iconic masters rares have a chance to recover even sooner since Pro Tour Rivals of Ixalan is a Modern format rather than the usual standard format.  
3. Dominaria absolutely has potential, just because there is a chance of getting some rather new types of dual lands. My prediction is that these lands are the cards to at least have before 2018 rotation.  
4. Rivals of Ixalan will at least be better than Ixalan, limited wise. The limited format is godawful due to the overemphasis of tribal synergies, and the lack of support of Black-Green and Blue-White. Usually in a GOOD large set draft there is a gold uncommon cycle that feature all TEN of the two color combinations. The fact that they left out two was a huge warning flag for the limited format. There has never been too much of a big hype for the core sets, but I think that M18 is going to have a few surprises there. Origins had quite a few surprises to send off the core set (I fondly remember the flip walkers, even though I NEVER pulled one out of the twenty drafts that I did back in 2015.  
5. It would be absolutely foolish for wizards to do another masters set this year when we already have M25 announced. Just look at how badly Ixalan, Iconic, and Unstable got split in player interest upon their releases.   
5b. Not sure they do a Pauper Masters... I think Eternal Masters 2 is more likely than a Pauper Masters and would come first before they think of that (Hey, they have to leave a set of Rishadan Port right?)
6. That's really going to be pushing things. I think there is a higher than negligible chance that Rishadan Port gets put in that set though.  
7. Agreed. I personally am going to wait 2 weeks after the print run before pulling the trigger.  
8. Definitely more reserve list shenanigans will come up in 2018. It doesn't help that financiers like Rudy will only make the Reserve list platform even more unstable. I think we may see more Vintage tournaments allowing a wider number of proxies as a result of this.  
9. MTGO is a sinking ship. Absolutely nothing should be touched in that platform with a ten foot pole. That's even if MTG arena doesn't catch fire (It has some potential though).
10. Yeah, the card quality problem should be a top priority for Wizards. It's been talked to death by Wedge, The Professor, and many other well known keepers of the community.  

My own personal prediction:  
I think there will be unbannings for Modern to shake up the Pro Tour. I am keeping a close eye on BBE (and I know a lot of other people are) and Stoneforge Mystic (a long shot, but actually possible from what I have heard). Standard will face maybe one banning to rein in Energy decks.

Wizards will never give any support to pauper. The least of which is the design space of commons and uncommons would have to be considered if they want to support it with product releases.

You can buy x4 common/uncommon sets of new releases on Ebay for like 40 bucks. Wizards does not want widespread adoption of a format that requires so little to purchase.

2. They missed some obvious tokens in unstable, especially with the full art backs. I’m expecting the this treatment to make an appearance in future FNM promos, starting with DOM or possibly core set. 

3. Silver boarder sells. Unstable seen as a success and lands are a good hold long term. Probably won’t be another full unset for a few years but wouldn’t be surprised to see silver boarder December make an appearance again in 2018 and some small supplemental (possibly holiday reprints) silver product next year. 

4. Arena will be huge success. Long term, paper Mtg format will be created to match “Arena” format will be non rotating probably kaladesh on. They might possibly start later but Maro has expressed interest in an eternal format without fetch lands. Treat rotation accordingly. 

5. 2000$ timetwister. Commander legality is so much more important than vintage. Move sooner rather than later. It’ll be a target this tax return season. There will always be rich kids wanting to stomp their friends. 

6. No movement on reserve list from Wotc. Long term (2-3 years) Disney will buy hasbro. They are not going to say no to printing liquid gold and will slowly abolish and reprint the reserve list. Better lawyers than hasbro, more willingness to fight it. The actual motivation  for the sale will be toy production, specifically Star Wars toys, but long term Disney will do well with Wotc brands and magic will enter a new renaissance. 

7. Blue FBB lands price correct to four figures. They have yet to catch up to the jumps in prices in white boarder. As people look to pimp their legacy decks, the demand on three will go up.

1) Rivals will be an average set that will impact standard. However standard will continue to lose popularity in the paper world.

2) Arena will release and people will play standard mostly there. Magic will grow in popularity and some users of arena will transition to paper.

3) Standard will still die off in most stores and become like the old block constructed. A test for the pros for a couple of weeks for big events like the pro tour but regular people won't touch it as much.

4) Wizards will create a new format somewhere between standard and modern. 

5) Dominaria will be popular but won't fix standard in the paper world. People will play it a lot in arena.

6) The masters set will be better than iconic masters but not as popular as a modern masters.

7) Wizards will bow to pressure and do a pauper GP. They simply need more competitive formats. and they will do a gp in each continent similar to how they do legacy now.

8) Game codes in physical packs will become a thing and more products will get more premium features. (foil tokens, masterpiece cards etc.)

9) Local stores will start getting more business later in the year as people transition from arena. I still think it depends on their ability to make a format similar to extended or frontier that is cheap and has a wide range of strategies.

3) Dominaria will be great. Masterpieces will be amazeballs.
4)Rivals will help ixalan limited but, just like it's predecessor, it won't do dick all for standard. Core set will be a great limited set and will reinvigorate standard with new blood (once KLD rotates)
5) pauper has already started taking off. It's great. 1000x better than frontier but a pauper masters is unlikely unless it's like 3 card packs or something.

If it's a good way to play Magic and cheap, it starts competing not just with Hearthstone (which WotC want), but also with paper Magic.

If there is any appreciable churn from paper to Arena (low double digit percentage of the playerbase), a lot of paper stores will collapse. This is great news for dealer chains with enough capital to profit from the misfortune of small store owners, but it's terrible for the playerbase (short term) and Wizards (medium term), to say nothing about the dealers themselves.

________

If Wizards are smart, they will make Arena less of a solid value proposition so as to keep paper-to-Arena churn in the single figures (percentage of players).

And Wizards are smart.

Wizards will want Arena to mostly be a player acquisition tool for paper, not a substitute for it. Like Duels was (the most successful acquisition tool paper ever had).

I will be able to purchase a box of Iconic Masters for less $ than I can purchase a box of Unstable.  I expect this might be true at the end of 2018.   Not sure what prices will be like after that.

1)  I expect the Unstable reprint to not effect the booster box prices too much.  I think they're going to reprint with the goal of satisfying drafting demand for the next few months.  After that, WOTC focus will be on promoting and selling Masters 25 (March), Dominaria (April), Core Set 2019 (July).  The increase in product will lower the prices of things like the lands and tokens though.

2)  The people buying Unstable boxes are the casual players who care less about the value of individual singles.  The value is in the sealed product that can be used for draft.  It's one of the reasons why the shops around me aren't cracking boxes to resell singles.  Normally I feel like a booster box price and it's EV of singles are closely correlated.  With Unstable, I don't think this applies

3) Iconic Masters is a fine set to draft.  However, I found that nothing really stands out about the format to make it unique (whereas Unstable does).  Iconic Masters box price will be closely tied to the EV of it's singles.  With frequent reprints,  I think it'll take a much longer time before the sealed booster box price will go up.

So it wouldn't surprise me that at the end of 2018, the cheapest I can get an sealed box of Unstable for is $140.  And i'll still be able to pick up Iconic Masters boxes for less than $140",0.34303528,0.54266405,0.11430066,1.0,0.0

Arena is just the next Magic Duels with a Hearthstone interface.

It looks like a fucking joke, and I haven't even touched on 8-card packs. (LOL) Also if p2p trading isn't going to be allowed then good luck getting people to take it seriously as a way to play constructed formats.

1/ MM25 will began to touch at the RL with some old staples that made magic history, it wouldn't be THE anniversary edition if it does not contains any of the cards that made MTG, the print run will be low as it will be the test to see how the market and people react and to incite sellers to sell at MSRP.

2/ Challenger Decks will be very good with some unexpected reprints for modern and a very large distribution (and I mean very large) to incite new players to enter the format and allow players to buy at MSRP (for this they need to distribute them at Walmarts, as WPN stores only would create a speculation that would kill the intent).

3/ Then Dominaria will be a very big hit, and will bring back old players with again some new RL reprints (I would bet on dual lands).

4/ Core set 2019  will be the final touch with again some new RL reprints, it will be the equivalent of Revised, with some of the best staples that have been printed since.

1) Challenger decks are going to be a hit. They are going to be very good and Wotc will not screw it up. Standard (we can argue but I am pretty sure at least looking at my own LGS that it is on the decline). Standard needs a boost, and this is Wotc's solution. Will it work? Yes and No. Booster box sales of standard sets will plummet (except Dominaria), but challenger decks will sell well. They will be worth buying if you are interested in standard.

2) Iconic Masters will recover at the end of 2018. It will take that long to get back to 160. It is actually a good set. The value is in the rares and not the mythics. Players have not adjusted. People complained that M2015 value was all in the mythics, so this time they put it in the rares and people balked. For heaven's sake the dragons are rare and not mythic. We were spoiled with M2017, Iconic Masters was not that bad, so it will recover.

3) Dominaria will be remembered and will sell well just for nostalgia sake.

4) M2018, Rivals of Ixalan will be further failures. They will be printed to oblivion, and distributors will be stuck with them. Look for bargains here.

5) If Wotc does a second masters set, it will also be a disaster.

5) Paper pauper will start to take off. I would even be very happy with a Pauper Master's set. If this is the second masters set, it will be a huge hit.

6) the 25th anniversary will be a hit and they might surprise us with reserve list collection edition cards like power nine/ cradle, tabernacle??? - conspiracy theory here. I told you my predictions would be bold

7) Unstable lands will drop to 1-1.25 after the second print run and that is when you buy.

8) old school vintage cards will continue to go up as confidence erodes with massive print runs and fakes.

9) MTG arena will be successful. MTGO - yikes

721,5.0,"Yesterday someone pointed out that this card combos with a new card from Dominaria (Helm of the Host) and it got me thinking that this card has a little room to grow for a few reasons.

1. Although the combo probably isn't standard breaking or even all that good, players will want to try it and I wouldn't be surprised if it's popular amongst casuals
2. If you are playing it in the combo, you will need 4 copies of it. Being a Mythic, this demand has potential to drive price a little bit.
3. It's played in over 1700 decks on EDH rec including some really popular decks. This is a card that EDH players open and don't immediately get rid of. 
4. If brawl takes off, I could see this as a staple. 1700 decks isn't too shabby in a powerful format of EDH. In an underpowered format like Brawl, it could see it being one of the stronger cards available. When brawl was first announced, this was one of the cards that immediately jumped to my mind as a card that would be perfect for that type of format. 

I would probably try to trade for this card, but I probably won't be spending $2 on it. I'd feel better trading away cards that have peaked for it rather than buying them up. 

**The real take away is this:** If you have them sitting in a bulk box or if you were about to buylist this card, it might be time to sit on it a little longer and revisit this card after Dominaria comes out. May make you some extra cash if you have a lot of these around.

If you really want to buy from MCM, the best way to go would be bank transfer or coupons because of fees ( Be aware that even with bank transfer your bank may charge you a fee on an international tranfer) . Paypal fees are just ridiculous: 0.35€ + 5&#37; of the total buy. Does any of your relatives have a MCM account? because if they do, they can give you coupons for you to redeem in your account, kinda like a gift card. Or if you know anyone that you trust with an MCM account, you can ask them to print the coupons for you.

As other people have said, Italy's Post is just an embarrassment, I don't buy or sell to Italy ( you can filter this on MCM ) because it takes way too long and the amount of lost packages, to and from outside of Italy, is just unbelievable. So try to buy from Italian sellers, particularly Italian professional sellers and use registered mail, which will be more expensive, but if the cards don't arrive MCM will hold the money until the situation is resolved and MCM will 99&#37; side with the buyer on registered mail.

With all of this said, you would be better off to go an LGS, I think its too much trouble to go through just to buy cards for a tiny discount ( with all the fees and all ).

Cards that are usually cheaper here: any Japanese language, expeditions and alikes,  any new released set that professional sellers want to unload fast, judge promos.

789,1.0,"For at-a-glance prices, TCGPlayer's market value is the best IMO because it reflects what people are actually paying.  

Average is a terrible price indication IMO because it doesn't respect sales. It takes into account listings and is easily skewed by high priced listings. This is why it's usually higher than market value. It also isn't good enough to just both be using average and call it even because averages on each card aren't equally off. They're each influenced by the listings of that particular card.  

The *absolute* best price to use for a card's worth is to check yourself and see what the lowest price you could buy it at if you wanted it ""right now"" from a reputable seller. In the US, that usually means that you'd check TCGPlayer and Ebay, sort by lowest buy now and see what the price is for the lowest authentic copy from a high feedback seller is with shipping taken into account. An example of where this is better is something like Valakut recently. The market value remained around $15-$18 while there were no copies available anywhere for that price. Cheapest you could get it was $25. You might say ""well, Valakut is on it's way back down.. it wasn't worth $25"". Do not rely 100% on a third party to tell you what a card is worth. You've got to make *some* of the decision yourself. If you think Valakut isn't a $25 card, make a case to your trade partner and see if they agree in the form of being willing to lower it. If they don't agree, don't trade and see who was right in a couple of months.

Since that second method takes time, most people are going to want to just use market value.  ",0.32020167,0.53215027,0.14764799,16.0,0.0

792,4.0,"I think Average (Listed Median) is a better representation of what a card is really worth for several reasons:

1) We know how they got to the number.  Its the Median Average of all the copies listed for sale.  Very clean and very simple.  Market Price is a formula they've refused to fully divulge.  All they'll say is that its ""compiled from recent, completed sales that occurred on TCGplayer.com"".  
MTGGoldfish was going to switch to Market price a while back to make things more player friendly since most people see Market price as ""the price people expect to pay for the card when buying it.""  They switched over for about a half a day and all the Price Lists, Movers & Shakers, Price Histories, etc got messed up.  When they wrote to TCG about it trying to figure out where things went wrong and fix the error on Goldfish's end, TCG refused to tell them how they formulated Market price (even though Goldfish links people to TCG for sales) and they had to switch back to Average (Listed Median).

2) Market Price very poorly reflects accurate pricing on cards that have recently been bought out or are in the process of spiking.  [Look at ""Stoneforge Mystic"" (the original Worldwake printing) right now.](https://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/worldwake/stoneforge-mystic?partner=MTGGLDFSH)  As of me writing this, its Market Price is $32.29 and its Listed Median is $51.95.  But if you look at the site, the cheapest copy you can get right now is $37.85 for a Damaged copy ($39.29 for the next cheapest that isn't Damaged).  That's a $5 (or ~17%) price difference.  Putting aside the arguments about potential unbannings and overhyping etc, that's a pretty significant price difference.  

3) Average takes availability into account when reflecting the value of a card.  While a card maybe have ""Market Value"" of $50, if there's only 4 copies left listed on TCG, the Average will more than likely reflect that and allow for supply & demand to have a say in value.",0.38292384,0.5121282,0.10494802,2.0,0.0

I avoid “buy” prices or latest ebay sales because those snipped prices are not the norm. Median or Market are both good because it’s truly the average or close to what people are selling for.  A better average would be to probably find a price somewhere in the middle of median and market. It’s all dependent on how many Damaged/MP/LP  vs NM cards are being sold to affect market or how many are listed at a specific condition to affect median.  Just remember, your trading. Use trade value not the cheapest single listing you can find on a card. 

There are also other variables to consider. I know some people at GPs or finance guys who will trade reserved list vs non reserved list significantly in their favor if trading out of reserved list cards for non-reserved list cards.  You should treat reserved list cards as a premium.

853,0.0,"In hindsight, it's legitimately good. It's compared to Experiment One frequently, which held good value until it started getting reprinted frequently. That mechanic is popular.

Think about that Experiment One comparison a bit more though. You want to play E1 early. You *have* to so you can grow it using the rest of the creatures in your hand. If you top deck E1, it's a 1/1 and won't likely grow much because you already used your creature resources in your hand. Pelt Collector is similar early and better late because of the dies trigger. Your opponent is motivated to kill your larger creatures and that will grow Pelt Collector, whereas Experiment One would have remained a 1/1. 

It's Standard playable and can be slotted into Modern Bushwhacker Zoo and other aggressive Zoo variants.

This is a bit different than all those other ""sales posts"" in the way that I want to know what you guys think are CURRENTLY good purchases of foil rares and/or mythics for speculation purposes. What is good to buy now? What is underpriced? Keep in mind that when speculating for foil rares and/or mythic (even commons or uncommons if you can name any!) you must choose cards that work in eternal formats. Those are the ones that gain value over time. Those are you Search for Azcantas. Not cards to pimp out standard decks... I made that mistake in Ixalan buying a bunch of foil dinosaurs. FML; never again. 
I'll give two examples:

1) FOIL Mission Briefing
The number one reason is I see this card being a modern control staple is because of Miracles, namely in U/W Control. 

2) FOIL Pelt Collector
This card is a freaking beatstick and MagicAids already found a cool looking Zoo deck in Modern for it. I think it will be a staple in those kinds of builds, no matter what format you see it in.

Casual players love trample and because often the only thing that stops them from winning the game is the little creatures that get in the way or removal getting rid of key cards. Also if all not-garbage the removal in all of standard is pushed into black, black/green could become played.

The first leading indicator was KLD boxes, sealed, reaching US$100 then US$120 then US$140 last month. Was a matter of time before modern started using one of the 5 (in fact, inventor's fair has a slight uptick) in the tier 1-2 decks: UR phoenix (new), storm (not new -- very used), UR control/moon decks. The next one I'm expecting is the blooming marsh: modern ""The Rock"" and legacy ""turbo depths"" is still a thing.  


If RNA provides enough modern useable cards for both simic and orzhov, things will get a lot more interesting for the other two fastlands. After all, their prices are still low, and especially the DNT competitive modern community is very hungry for hatebears. After all, the modern DnT strongest build is the BWc now.

So with karn it is an instant lockpiece once they both hit the battlefield, locking every opponent out of their mana and any abilities they may have.

Karn, the Great Creator (4)

Artifact abilities of artifacts your opponents control can't be activated

Is this a good hold for the long run?  I know that there is no definite answer on the print run of this set (seems to be of great debate).

&#x200B;

so I've been drafting lately and don't feel like keeping all the cards, besides they are all standard, it's unlikely on average they'll have better pricing than now. I was wondering how do you sell the lots? Are there best practices? Like: 

* What % discount of the current market price of the valuable cards should one offer? 
* Should one list all the cards in the lot or only the rares/mythics and playables? Or none at all?
* Is there some magic ratio of good card/bulk cards to make a lot interesting?  For instance, the one I'm putting up is 5 mythics (2 see play in constructed), 25 rares (\~12 see play in constructed), 100 NC (didn't track count this part, say at least 20 or played in constructed), 370 C.  Which is roughly 30 boosters and good picking:P

&#x200B;

Thanks, I couldn't find a better place to ask. My brief competitor analysis on ebay lots showed mostly auctions with no card list, sometimes no pictures at all. I don't mind putting some time in, I just want to understand how to build the business process properly.

For instance, do we expect an influx of new tabletop players? Is it a coincidence that 2 of the 4 Challenger Decks are near exact copies of 2 of the 3 most dominant Bo1/Invitiational decks, WW and Mono-Red (and that the one that's not represented is both the most expensive to assemble and the trickiest to navigate)? I know WotC supposedly decided on the decklists a long time ago - but I'm sure they'd have a good idea of which decks would be strongest in the Duo Standard format they were planning.  
I also noticed Hydroid Krasis dropped from €22,- to €13,- over the past month (yes, EU here). Could this have to do with Sultai's bad positioning in Bo1?

If people who play Arena also get into paper in any form, then they will have to adapt to a different experience. Like someone else said, the LGS experience varies widely. I have had great experiences, and I have also played a small sample of cheaters and douche-bags. The LGS business model does not seem to be working too well. Some people have great LGSs (I do, even with the small number of bad experiences), and then others don't.

The biggest beneficiary of anything happening to Magic seems to be Commander. Who knew that the format junk rares went to get played would be such a huge success?

I think also you mistake reserve list cards being played as them being ‘staples’. On the cEDH side they’re more common as some deck strategies even essentially require them (looking at you [[Hermit Druid]]) but even there they aren’t staples with really only non-budget decks and primers listing them unless someone happens to own one anyways. And since the format is non-competitive people are typically very ok with a nicer proxy (though it’s not like new players coming off Arena are going to jump right into paying a couple hundred bucks for luxury designer cardboard anyways lol)

1290,18.0,"I've been thinking about what will happen when eventually a portion of the new players that Arena is bringing in get into paper magic and which constructed formats will see the most financial opportunity.

Arena is great of course, easy drafts and affordable standard decks. Solving some of the problems that people who don't have an LGS might have. But the main thing Arena lacks is the ability to play with friends at the kitchen table. Playing either competitive or more casual. No matter which, the experience is undeniably better in person.

Some competitive players will eventually switch to modern, because of it's more stable meta and the ability to play your favorite decks with longer lasting success. A surge of new players will inevitably inflate the price of modern singles and with modern now being the figurehead of paper magic (now that Arena has claimed Standard) I predict that WoTC will be reprinting most of the modern staples to keep the format accessible. You can already see this in the M20 leyline reprints ( \[\[Leyline of the Void|M20\]\] \[\[Leyline of Sanctity|M20\]\]), Ravnica block shockland reprints (\[\[Steam Vents|GRN\]\]) and I predict many more to come in the future. It's for this reason I am a little hesitant to put my money into Modern staples (I did buy a playset all of the Horizon lands (\[\[Fiery Islet|MH1\]\]), curious to see how this will work out).

The other format Arena does't feature is Comander/EDH. And this is where my interest currently lies!  
I believe this format has stayed under the radar a bit. Not a great amount of reprints, at least not in standard sets. UMA was of course Reprint City with things like \[\[Demonic Tutor|UMA\]\], \[\[Back to Basics|UMA\]\], \[\[Temporal Manipulation|UMA\]\], \[\[Phyrexian Altar|UMA\]\], \[\[Phyrexian Tower|UMA\]\], \[\[Ancient Tomb|UMA\]\], \[\[Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth|UMA\]\] and some more. But UMA was a premium set, so reprint's did not hugely impact single prices. The format is still being supported and marketed by WoTC with some cool new commanders being printed every new set and a commander product coming later this year (word on the street is that it's gonna be good). The format also features many great reserved list staples with things like original dual lands (\[\[Volcanic Island|3ED\]\]), Urza's Saga Lands (\[\[Gaea's Cradle|USG\]\]) and many more very playable reserved list cards. Because there's so many reserved list staples I find it unlikely that WoTC will reprint the entire format to keep it accessible. There are just too many cards to be able to do this and this would just create enormous price gaps between the format's reserved and non-reserved staples (which is already the case) and not solve much at all.

WoTC seems to be focusing on keeping modern accessible and Commander has been avoiding the reprints. What do you guys think? Will this hold up? I'm very interested in your opinion!

I know prices can fluctuate without warning, but it seems like most of the time big changes go along with tournament play and happen in response to posted top decklists, banlist announcements, new set spoilers, and similar mtg news.

Esper Stax running Doom Foretold and Dance of the Manse makes a surprise entrance in the early meta. Fires of Invention Superfriends also swoops in, accompanied by some of the Castles.

The meta is turning up greedy for colors and curving out at 4 mana, so Fabled Passage is seeing plenty of play right now. 

Wicked Wolf is surprisingly good in a CMC with a ton of competition (namely Questing Beast, Ambusher, and Ceratops).

Feasting Trollgaak is a monster in limited, and is putting up some results in standard along with The Great Henge and friends. Nissa continues to be reliable top-end in most green decks as well.

I personally have yet to see a Stonecoil Serpent played in constructed, likely due to Hydroid Krasis and fight club hydra overwhelming it. Maybe it'll see play in non-UGx decks as a competitor, maybe post-rotation.

Cavalcade triggers are all now 3 damage instead of 1. All on-death triggers (footlight fiend, ember hauler, those little devils Tibalt makes) are suddenly 3-4 damage each. Scorch Spitters are suddenly firing off 3 damage fireballs. Spitfires now hit for +2 on top of all their pumps from the cavalcade/ScorchSpitters. Shocks are suddenly 4 damage. Heartfire is now 6 damage.

I run 2 of those in my deck, and it's a pretty consistent win con. I am considering moving to 3 copies for even more consistency. 

&#x200B;

I collect paper MTG more than I play it. I rarely play in store, mostly with friends, so I can't attest to what I see in play out in the wild. I only know what I see playing in Arena. Of course since the set isn't out yet, it's really hard to tell what you will see for a while in person.

The current Cavalcade build is really cheap, financially speaking. Adding Torbran changes the deck entirely into a powerful heavy hitter IMO.

Hopefully some actual play experience with this may help in decision making, who knows if the play base will actually buy into it or not.

I would like to buy a playset of these for my own collection before prices go up. I really love this card.

1505,5.0,"It's all Pauper-based demand as it got heavily featured in [this article](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-throne-of-eldraine-pauper-set-review/):

>Without a doubt, Mystic Sanctuary will be the highest-impact card in the set (assuming the bannings don’t change things too much–which is possible). Blue Flicker decks have already established themselves as the top strategy and this is a card that directly ports, in a powerful way, into those decks.

>Jeskai seems able to easily use Mystic Sanctuary because it already plays a mostly Snow Island mana base. Tron will include a singleton copy of the land to find with Expedition Map. I have a strong feeling that Bant Flicker just got the tool it needed to become a Tier 1 strategy. So, basically this is a card that all the Flicker decks wanted and can use to great effect. Let’s discuss the applications for each deck real quick.

>Tron: Tron already plays Mortuary Mire to not deck itself, and this is a strictly better Mortuary. It makes blue, rather than black. By the time you are worried about decking, it should be easy to have three other Islands in play to set up the Ghostly Flicker Loop. In Tron, Mystic Sanctuary is an upgrade.

>Jeskai: It’s the biggest freeroll in Jeskai because the mana base already has a ton of islands. In a sense, it will allow Jeskai a few things: First, redundancy of the Ephemerate combo. If the opponent can break up the loop, for instance by fizzling an Ephemerate, Jeskai can buy it back and start over. Secondly, it allows Jeskai to play its sideboard cards repeatedly once they’ve been drawn.

>Bant: The Bant Familiars deck was already extremely good and it is actually able to take the best advantage of Mystic Sanctuary. It has an Island-heavy mana base already and the Familiars team up to make Ghostly Flicker + Mystic Sanctuary + Mulldrifter a deadly engine and capable of looping without a Wall or Archaeomancer.

>It’s also worth noting that bouncelands can pick up and redeploy Mystic Sanctuary to generate additional triggers as the game goes on.

>When I was brewing Fastbond combo decks, I understood there were basically no land options that do what Mystic Sanctuary does, so on uniqueness alone the card is significant. The one thing that annoys me about the card in Pauper is that we don’t have instant-speed interaction for lands to fizzle a Ghostly Flicker–nothing but a counter breaks it up. The Flicker decks are already trying to ignore everything the opponent does, so I guess it’s only fitting they get a combo that is even more difficult for non-blue decks to interact with. Answers are not nearly as cheap as the proactive cards.

>There’s little doubt in my mind that Sanctuary is straight-up broken card that will make its impact felt not just in Pauper, but in every format ranging from Legacy (Miracles), Commander, Modern (Cryptic Command) to Standard.

While I don't agree with the last sentence and think this card will only get played in fringe decks in Modern (Mono U Turns comes to mind), I can see the appeal in Pauper.",,,,2.0,0.0

1560,1.0,"**For the style of cards:** My expectation is that shops will not adjust their buylists for the fact that there are 4 versions of a card rather than 2. The market will be split between functional plays - those who buy played cards to get the cheapest possible and collectors who just want bling. The collectors won't care about the base version of cards. Whether they prefer regular foil or extended art/alternate border non-foil is to debate but evidently the most sought after card will be the extended art/alternate border foil (the most premium bling). 

&#x200B;

My guess is that even the best chase rare will not be that expensive due to the multiple versions showing up. My other guess is regular foils will also command a much lower premium than people are used to. The increased foil pull rate and the fancy card frames will crowd out the regular cards. I would sell every version other than the foil full-arts, and especially look to sell the in-between versions (non-foil extended art and regular foils)

&#x200B;

**For the specific cards that are overhyped:** It depends on the next standard Tier 1 meta. I don't think many cards will make a splash into eternal formats whilst they are still in standard. Even good EDH cards like the Great henge can't spike because the set is still in print. So you can probably read up on the best standard decks, make your bets and sell the cards that don't appear in the likely lists. 

&#x200B;

In regards to how GP mtl went in previous years, I've been in last couple of years and usually the prices are insanely inflated for hyped-up cards.

1561,2.0,"So I busted a case of ELD over the weekend. I've got approximately 4 if each rare and 2 of each mythic. 
So my question is, what cards would you sell into the hype, and what cards would you hold on to? Seeing as the main event is Limited, I imagine getting rid of my standard traders on the Friday is probably best. However, I've also never attended a MF or GP that's fallen on release weekend for a standard set, so I have no idea what the vendor buylist pricing will be like. Does anyone have any experience with that in the past? 
Bonus question, what do I do with my extended art cards from the Collector's boosters? I think I should probably move the non foils ones immediately, but I'm not sure.

1581,1.0,"current take: This is going to have a big impact on the Pioneer meta, and Pioneer is the number one source of MtG market volatility recently.  There's a lot of parallels between this and Cat Combo, but this is better for several reasons:

1. As an indestructible Enchantment, Heliod is way harder to remove than Saheeli

2. Unlike Cat Combo, which needed WUR to work, this only requires one white mana source over two turns, this is way more splashable

3. Ballista by itself is just a good card, and Heliod may be solid in the correct shell.  Either way, unlike Cat Combo decks that threw away 7-8 slots on two cards that weren't very good outside of being an ""I Win"" button, at worst a deck is only using up 3-4 slots on Heliod for their ""I Win"" button, an potentially there's no significant loss to running both of these cards.

4. Cat Combo needs to swing out and is weak to instant speed removal.  As long as there's mana available this wins through removal.

Anyway, this is better Cat Combo that fits into more lists.  Pioneer already took Walking Ballista from a 12-15 dollar card to a 17-20 dollar card.  This could very easily send the price even further up.

The problem is the power.  I am fully convinced Heliod or Ballista will eat a ban because of this.  Can't really begin to guess which, but if this puts up Pioneer results (and I'm 100% convinced it will) then I'd call Ballista a risky keep.

EDIT:  Nuclear Take incoming:  If this combo takes off, there will probably be a big emphasis on preventing lifegain.  Invest in Atarka's Command, Skullcrack, Rampaging Ferocidon.",0.10575268,0.47314194,0.42110533,20.0,0.0

1583,3.0,"I said most of this in a thread for cube, but I'm curious what the folks over here think.

It seems that the combo between this card and walking ballista is likely not a concern in modern, where a t4 combo is par for the course, but it is notable that oko can't hit heliod unless he's a creature, which is unlikely if you're just going for the combo. I think the combo is just a bit too slow for modern, or at the very least it doesn't currently look better than druid combo. I don't see many ways to do the combo before turn 4, and I'm not confident it's always going to happen on turn 4. You do have a few turns to set up mana or scales, but it seems a smidge vulnerable. 

Pioneer looks doable though.

given that the goal is to get out a ballista with 2 counters and have the 2 mana to activate heliod on the same turn, it seems likely to me that this combo would want to be in a hardened scales list, since with scales out, this is doable by t4. Heliod obviously doesn't slot into the GB hardened scales lists as they currently exist, so either the list goes abzan to keep [[winding constrictor]], or people simply shift to Selesnya Scales. Either way, the manabase takes a hit. GB has great lands to use but tacking on white does reduce the consistency a tad, and the ally dual lands are just worse. Granted, the W and B are mostly just splashes for one key card each, constrictor and this new heliod. An effective deck that can take advantage of the combo might not take long to get started, and the scales decks are already really good.

I'm not too worried if it stays around 15-20 dollars, and it doesn't look like this card is a huge concern exceptfor pioneer, though I think it likely sees standard play. Thoughts? Pick up ASAP? Wait and see?",0.38436502,0.4856137,0.1300214,7.0,0.0

Leyline is a card you play when you want to just nuke a graveyard strategy, like Dredge or Reanimator.  I don't think Standard is going to be so rife with graveyard-based action that you'll need to go to Leyline to fight it all.  I think something like Return to Nature is a way better card for what you want to be able to do in Standard.  Being able to single out the Elspeth from the graveyard while also having a card that can fight over things like Fires of Invention is more what I'd be interested in.  That card in particular is poised to get a lot better actually, now that I think about it.  Depending on how things shake out, it could even carve out a role as a green Doom Blade if there are any widely-played enchantment creatures.

1689,4.0,"Disclaimer: I'm a Canadian so my views on these topics are based on the Canadian market and retailers but should still apply to the US market (hopefully).

Hello, over the past couple of months after building numerous EDH decks, I noticed that the various online retailers here were selling singles at sometimes wildly different prices. I found it easy to use 3-4 online retailers, find the cards I wanted at the lowest price among them, and then use their free or very low cost shipping option to net huge savings on cards. These ""savings"" were perceived as a comparison of the spot singles prices to a US benchmark such as TCG, or other US retailer prices.

Why is this important? 
Well, this is mtgfinance. Ideally, we should not only speculate on future gains on cards but also try to find a current price that is acceptable to purchase the single at. Unlike stocks, we can't simply assess balance sheets or discount future cash flows to determine an asset's intrinsic value or price. So I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, we have to rely heavily on retailers to set prices based solely on demand and supply of the singles. Not surprisingly, this gives retailers a lot of power to determine singles prices and takes away from from the idea of an efficient market that would ideally be present for our secondary market here. 

The upside?
It seems that because of this, at least in Canada, this results in quite a bit variance between singles prices. If a decent benchmark can be found that somewhat accurately reflects the instrinsic value of the single based on supply and demand, then you could use that benchmark to take advantage of price arbitrage when you are looking to buy singles. For those that do not know, the gist of arbitrage theory is that in an efficient market, buyers and sellers would take advantage of price differences and thus, by increasing or decreasing demand of specific assets, bring asset prices to their intrinsic value across markets. This definitely does not seem the case for the mtg market, at least in Canada, and gives us the opportunity to search for the lowest price for each single.

What to do with this information?
Considering these points, I would urge those of you who are not loyal to a specific retailer, or have a local game store to support, to shop around for your singles as you are likely to find the lowest prices for your singles by spreading your total purchase across numerous retailers. 

Discussion
This post may seem obvious to some, but I hope it reaches someone who finds this information useful. What do you guys think? Do you have another means to find lower singles prices that you are willing to share? Is there a reliable benchmark that we should know about to use for prices? General thoughts?

To attempt to help understand my interpretation of the MB1 inclusion...

  
The effect on the EDH format that I had expected was for MB1 to lower the value of the EDH format. However, the opposite occured. This leads me to believe, and you're welcome to your own interpretation, that the majority of cards in EDH are not worth that much, and the addition of the reprints, while lowering the cost of possible staples, was still able to raise the average value of cards in the format by a measurable degree.  


Pioneer on the other hand, which has a much smaller amount of legal cards that are legal, experienced the effect on the average to higher degree due to the smaller amount of cards.",,,,144.0,1.0

I don’t think the situation has gotten bad enough that I’d buy right now though. A lot of the US(including all the card stores) is basically closed until May 1st. Furthermore, it’s not like come May 2nd everything in retail just snaps back to normal. Retailers and card stores are probably going to spend the better part of this year crawling back to normal, if that’s even possible. People and stores in general are probably at the start of a yearlong struggle.

FWIW, I’m kind of in the same boat as you. I want some eurekas, a tabernacle, and maybe an unlimited dual or two to round out my legacy collection.

I think a few weeks from now will the peak buying time for those wanting to pick up duals, legends/arabians staples, or power nine.

Inventories of Tabernacle,Nether void, Chains, Abyss, all power save timetwister are quite high. I've been watching Card Kingdoms inventory after recent vintage price reductions and noone has bought a single card($400 and up EDH staples) in weeks.

In a different possible future where MTGmintcard goes tomorrow, CFB goes under in June and the others survive, July or August is when you should buy.

File an FTC complaint. FTC regulations state that if an online order is delayed by 30 or more days the company has to request confirmation from the customers that they are aware of the delay and still agree to the purchase or issue a refund. Specifically, that if the customer does not respond, they are obligated to issue the refund. Wizards violated this regulation and have made it clear through their inaction and lack of communication that they don't really care about the impact to their customers.

To those that say we're whining/ungrateful and that we can't blame WotC for the global pandemic:

That's not what we're doing, we're blaming WotC for 

1) Not communicating and updating more regularly and clearly about the delays, not explaining the details at all, not justifying the continual release, production, and shipment of new products.

2) Not providing public information about any compensation for the delay, not reaching out to customers to help determine appropriate compensation, then mistakenly providing excess compensation to some customers and deciding not to match that compensation for the rest of us.",0.81372,0.17293051,0.0133494465,158.0,0.0

Fetch lands are a necessary game pieces in multiple formats. The demand is nearly EVERY magic player(hell, even I want more of them for commander decks) and the supply is limited to 2 sets(one of them a 10$/pack masters set) and an overpriced Secret lair for the enemy fetches. 

Blinging is a completely separate issue from reprints as the point is to use the most exclusive versions of cards, not just exclusive cards. Wotc is doing a great job making desirable premium versions of cards for those with greater financial means to soak up.",0.06911765,0.39868504,0.53219736,1.0,0.0

1830,10.0,">If we all want the financial barrier of entry to Magic decreased significantly, doesn’t the excitement of “blinging out” a Commander deck, or cracking the most expensive new foil mythic simultaneously evaporate?

You can find Birds of Paradise printings for under $7, but foil 7th edition Birds of Paradise is still a $500+ card.  The fact that Birds of Paradise is widely available apparently doesn't diminish the fact that foil 7th edition printings are considered highly desired.  Foil Onslaught Flooded Strand is a >$250 card, even though you can get Khans printings for <$20.

If you show up to a Commander game at a playgroup that allows proxies and all of your fetchlands are Expeditions, you're still the guy whose Kenrith has all ten Expeditions.  It doesn't seem like making the game accessible does anything to diminish the coolness of having collected those cards; if anything, making the game more accessible means more people in the store to impress with your blinged-out collection.

In fact, having a $500 version of a card that other people can get for $7 (e.g. foil 7th edition Birds of Paradise) is *more* of a flex than having a $500 version of a card that other people can get for $80 (e.g. foil Worldwake Jace): it says ""Yeah, I could have got the super cheap version, but I decided to go all-out.""",0.0797851,0.45446977,0.46574518,1.0,0.0
1831,11.0,"I also think alot of folks here undermine the draw of cracking a pack as value aswell. For example, I can buy a fetchland for around $30 dollars, or I can buy a pre release kit for that same $30 dollars. Which is the better value? I come out with more rares and cards from the pre release kit, or just 1 powerful fetchland. I think this is a wedge for alot of folks who want to see there dollar go farther. I think folks would rather take all the money they were going to spend on a single card and instead get much more for it. 

I also think this plays into the question ""whose buying booster packs?"". Most often people say drafters and collecters/flippers are the main consumer. The more frugal buy singles. I think this is wrong. I bet most players have a spending limit when  purchasing,

For example:  the frugal player wont spend more than $5 or $10 on any single card. Instead of spending $25 on the one single card they'd like out of a set, they'd rather buy $25 on booster packs and get several rares and other cards instead. 

Perceived value still exists outside of magic, and if your working your ass off for 16 bucks an hour and justify converting 2 hours of work into a single piece of cardboard vs 4 or 5 booster packs, most people will crack packs.

Which then leads into the issue of double masters. Most players will see the prices of singles in the set as too high even after the price drop.

 For example: doubling season, this card is currently $64 CAD, much too expensive for most folks to drop on a single piece. so Double masters releases and drops the price to $32 dollars, much more affordable. But that same player is still baulking at the price. So then the rational for them is to take that $32 dollars and buy some double masters packs instead to get better value for your dollar. Except that a single pack of double masters is $16 which is comparatively bad value vs a standard set booster. Also that $16 booster could have 2 bulk rares worth nothing. So instead that player is left out and goes and buys some standard set packs at a better perceived value.

I agree with this sentiment, and I have even been one of those people, saying “Wizards, please help lower the financial barrier of entry so that my beloved format (Legacy, Vintage...now Modern) doesn’t die.“

Simultaneously, I see people show up to FNM, or my local playgroup, quite ecstatic about the latest “blinged out” additions to their beloved decks. And even more often at prerelease, or while drafting, I see people crack monetarily valuable cards and their happiness is palpable.

It'll be interesting to see what product ultimately gets short-printed.  M21 may not receive another major print run for a while, if ever, since there are few in-person events to encourage buying/cracking.  Mystery Boosters seem like a distant memory given that WotC can't print the upcoming product they've already promised (including Secret Lairs).  JumpStart is a product designed for ~~draft~~ **in-person** **play** at stores, so if I was WotC I'd put my focus elsewhere.

Many times they remain factually correct but the wording, timing, or method of releasing the info has been provocative in terms of financial impact on the market.  There has been artificial shortages creating a heightened yet fake FOMO demand for recent products.  

The bulk of the Jumpstart product ordered my be delayed 1-2 months, this only should matter for right now. In the next 2 months this should not impact the product price at all as a large supply glut of Jumpstart will flood the market just as Double Masters prepared for release. 

This is happening right now with Ikoria Collectors boxes hitting the market right now and bringing down the prices for the two weeks before just as Core 2021 is rolled out.

This happened 2 months ago with the free LGS Mystery Boxes hitting the market within 2 weeks of the Ikoria Collectors boxes release.  Yes Rudy messed up the release day inventory with his large secondary market purchases but it looks like the expected print amount finally hit the markets once Amazon and others began receiving their pallets.  But the artificially created temporary Ikoria shortage drove prices up by nearly $100/box in 3 weeks. 

All of this is timed to coincide with the regular cycle of values going down on the previous set in anticipation of the next product release to ease suspicion of manipulation by WOTC. 

The only true supply impacted product I see for 2020 are the Commander Decks.  I don't think there will be a Commander reprint for the simple reason that the obnoxious bulky Commander packaging is too cumbersome to tie up the printers with given the amount of other products that need to be printed in 2020 that are packaged in regular packs and booster boxes.

1914,3.0,"I don't think there will be any in paper in the USA.

[Per Wotc](https://magic.gg/news/magicfest-cancellation), there will be no large paper events in 2020.  When pressed about 2021, the response has been that the moratorium on 2020 events is based on player safety for COVID19 and they can't make any promises right now.

If there's a vaccine discovered tomorrow and rushed to production, events in January of 2021 might be possible.  That means that any cards currently in Standard have a maximum paper shelf life of about 6 months.  It is highly likely that events in 2021 won't resume in January.  Keep in mind that CFB Events is dissolving, so even if WotC gives the all clear, there will still need to be a lot of paperwork done before an actual Magic Fest can be scheduled.  It's more likely that in a less-than-best-case scenario, events above the FNM level wouldn't resume until Q2 or Q3 2021, and everything that's currently in Standard rotates in Q3 2021.  That cards from IKO are never legal in a Standard Magic Fest is entirely within the realm of possibility at this time.

To put it simply, there's no demand for paper Standard cards now, there will be no demand for Standard cards for the next six months, and only in a very good case scenario will there be demand for paper Standard cards before they rotate next year. 

While many players may not be aware of the 2020 moratorium, I think enough of them know that there's no Magic for awhile yet and will be reluctant to move on Standard cards at rotation.

I have no idea what things will look like on MTGO or outside the US.

TL;DR: There is effectively zero demand for paper Standard cards in the US courtesy of COVID19, and the window for their to ever be demand on ELD-M20 cards cuts it close.",0.43699497,0.48664755,0.07635746,1.0,0.0

EDIT: well I just realized this is the mtg finance subreddit, so proxying may not be what you want to do. Too many mtg subreddits. From a player perspective, my point still stands. From the financial side, it may be a bit tougher to navigate the constant releases. I could see myself getting burnt out with all the new content that keeps coming out.",0.5831514,0.32688275,0.08996584,8.0,0.0

But this part of this post describes what I think how the future looks like :

„

...
In parallel I’m also playing Yu-Gi-Oh mostly just for fun and nostalgia reasons but I already owned a Tier 1 deck and played in some tournaments (highlighting „owned“) . 
So I’m some how educated when it comes to the „Economy“ of the Japanese Cardgame. As we all aware, Konami is well known for its philosophy to reprinting staples in to oblivion (In special boxes) until they worth not more than 10€ for a frequently played 3 off tournament card staple . On the top of this Konami introduced in 2019/20 a rarity (Starlight Rare / Collectors Rare) where staples (yes they picked frequently played tournament staples ) are printed as lottery cards in boosters so artificially rare, that the prices of these versions are so ridiculous high that the most expensive staple (card is not older than 2y) can compete with some FBB blue generating Duals (older than 15 years). Before this newer, more rare and flashier rarity was introduced, Konami had a lot more (former) high end rarities wich also outshined the older ones before (Secret Rare , Ultimate Rare, Ghost Rare). 

The arrival of the newer and more limited rarity , wich is now the Starlight/Collectors rare, was followed by the immediate outshining of their less limited version. What will outshining it in the future ? Konami wants to make money and they are showing this to their playerbase so obviously that they also reprint ban-worthy cards some months before the real ban happens to milk the rest out of them. (Thats why my deck isn’t t1 any more)

What we now witnessing is the beginning of the exact same approach. Wizards is copying this from Konami. More and More flashy versions entering the marked in form as a boxtopper or foil versions in collectors booster displays or secret lairs. Also bannings in Standard are also decided more clearer by considering financial reasons (of course wizards wants to make money ). 

„

The thing is my (family &) friends playing now competitive YGO. They stopped playing after School (age was somehow 14)but as they saw how I’m playing MTG (for me now almost 14 years) competitively they somehow got back in to the game 3 years ago. So basically I’m playing magic on my own with people of my lgs . But now there is a chance for me to enjoying again a tcg with my „real“ friends ... 

Now with this development of MTG im considering quitting mtg(finance) or just buying cards wich I’m enjoying the most. Basically this is what I’m doing in YGO : if there is a alternate version I’d like to enjoy, I buy it only with the knowledge that it can be worthless tomorrow. It’s never meant to get back money out of it or make profit!

I'm of the opinion that, regardless of any economic hardships or Hasbro/Wizards insanity, there will never be a shortage of amazing people in our community that are willing to step and and make new content, or open a store etc, regardless of the current state of the game.   Peaks, valleys and all that of course, but time has proved the game is just too damn good to ever actually kill outright.  Wizards will make mistakes and game stores will suffer because of it, but that dream of opening a successful game store to carve out a career as a purveyor of the greatest game ever created is just too strong to discourage people, reason or facts be damned. 

I'm NOT a fan of magic as a player or seller right now, but I'm optimistic about the future.

I opened a collector zendikar rising box and got lucky with a scalding tarn and wooded foothils foils.
I'm selling them and few other cards to get my money back and I'm considering 2 options :

-Buying 2 VIP double masters boosters for ~175€ w/ shipping

-Buying another collector zendikar rising for 207€ w/ shipping



I feel like I would be pressing my luck buying another zendikar rising box and I've got most of the set's cards I wanted for edh. On the other hand, I'm also affraid that buying only 2 VIP boosters is a higher risk ( and maybe lower reward ) buy BUT there are more cards that I could use in 2xm.

I’m sure a lot of you have been following the price of Timetwister over the last couple of weeks. Since so few copies are available on TCG player (only two  at the moment, listed at 3300$ and 7500$), this increase in price has not been visible on sites like MTGstocks nor MTGGOLDFISH. How ever, the price for an PL (HP) Unlimited Timetwister has jumped from 1400€ to 3300€ during the last two weeks on Cardmarket - and similar jump in the US.

The obvious reason is, that Timetwister is used in EDH and that RL fomo led some people to buy their copy now, and afterwards some sellers re-listed with higher prices.

Naturally, both CE and IE stock have declined and increased in price.

If EDH continues to gain popularity, which it definitely will, I am beginning to think that Timetwister (Unlimited Version) within the next 5 years or so could replace Black Lotus, as the most expensive card and sought after card (not talking Alpha and Beta here, since those prices are mostly collector driven).

2070,9.0,"The new zendikar decks are overall great products. They aren’t super powerful, but are priced accordingly( this matters as any higher of a price point like $40 each would make this an overpriced/bad product). The decks themselves have some synergy and are easily upgradable. The cards aren’t worth much, but a few unopened deck may be worth keeping. 

Honestly this can go both ways for buying/opening mtg product (long term-hold then sell years later strategy). Opening and cracking for singles are no longer financially viable (unless u hit the lottery/flashy/hyped card every time). Holding is a better option, but at that point don’t expect anything more than a small margin (2-5 year period) and a larger margin at (10+ year period). It also has to be a lot of product or you’ll wait 5 years for an extra $10 dollars in your pocket. The zendikar set on the other hand will age badly financially for anything less than a collectors booster or box topper. 

The prices on staple singles are low enough for me to finally play the game with mechanically good cards (mana spree, landfall, draw, etc). The flashy appeal has taken the focus away from the old (regular frame and foil) and into the new (borderless, alternative, showcase foil). The reprints have also contributed to some of these markdowns. The value of a card will return to its playability and synergy. The rarity and art aspect for the collectors market is dead on arrival for recent sets unless u like having 10 different versions/variants of jace.

A high amount of reprints won’t allow cards to skyrocket similarly to how past cards rose in price range, but will also not plummet to pennies and destroy the mtg economy. Rather I strongly believe the market will correct itself and view the cards themselves for their value and it’ll be up to the player to choose which version he/she wants (this won’t affect the price unless there is a huge price swing between certain sets or your getting the original cards). One thing is for sure tho, special land cards (expedition, shocks, etc) will always have a high price tag on them, regardless of which variant/version u have because of its playability.",0.28679684,0.5331078,0.18009536,3.0,0.0

With 13€ each these are now below non-core Planeswalker decks. I bought and played both, liked them more than several of the C18 - C20 decks and the included reprints are solid, but not overwhelming.

So why is the product in such low demand?

Some possible answers:

1. 2nd wave (virus, not cardboard) is starting to hit europe.
2. Vendors need cashflow and firesale for minimal returns.
3. Overall sentiment towards MTG products.
4. Misperceived as equal to Planeswalker Decks.
5. Less new cards has lowered demand more than expected - medium value reprints arent that important.
6. Not a lot of hype around the decks - too much product to get attention.
7. Due to limited capacities WotC cant run the usual strategy of scarce 1st wave to push demand into flooding the market with 2nd wave - and the market is confused: ""What, i can buy product right away without overpaying??""
8. Crackers dont have the ressources to buy and flip the product (the amount of offered singles is relatively low).
9. no walkers

Ofc the singles are going down as well and many staples are on discount.

The review on the slabs and service have been mostly positive so far.

It will also depend what your looking to grade, BGS will authenticate and grade autographs, where CGC's signature series the autograph has to be made on site, but CGC will also grade misprints, and not deduct points for factory errors for an extra fee.

Another factor to consider is that CGC requires a subscription where I don't believe BGS does, so BGS might be preferred if your just looking to do a 1 shot order.",0.029582504,0.35690442,0.6135131,2.0,0.0

The last time I graded cards was in 2017 with BGS.  It appears that the cost has more than doubled since then!!! They still offer a more affordable option with just the one grade, but who wants that? I thought the 4 subgrades was the thing that made BGS 'better' than PSA.The poopy option costs what the regular grading used to cost! 

I'm a firm believer that grading will always demand a premium (especially with online selling).  Especially with all the Proxies (aka: fakes, counterfits, and forgeries) out there. So, at what value is it still worth it to grade? $300...$500....$1000+ 

Has anyone tried CGC grading?  I would think that their grading standards are more loose since they are just starting up (they want more customers). In the end, I have decided against using BGS as I do not appreciate price gouging. Thank you!",0.5211878,0.37625313,0.102559075,0.0,1.0

2106,4.0,"Here's the breakdown for these cards.

When art cards are sold, typically the appeal is in collecting a complete set.  Since they serve no function, the appeal is just in having a set of mini arts.  And people like collecting and completing things.

Magic is different in a few ways. For one, the normal cards serve a function.  The appeal of collecting is first in their ability to play the game.  There will always be people who try to complete magic sets, but the ""completion"" aspect tends to be more focused on your own decks.  

So already these have two strikes against them in regards to their appeal to most magic players.

Consider also that people are *especially* turned off to collecting everything right now because of the overflow of products. 

These remind me of when say, a video game releases collectable cards.  Sure, people like seeing the thing they like in other forms, but the appeal is so foreign to the original product, you can't expect much interest.

Despite being superficially similar in that these are both cards, it's the same think.  Nobody really cares about Magic cards that aren't Magic cards.

Outliers always exist, but unless we get our own ""Fuckface"" card, these are probably never going to do very well.

It's hard to tell what the future reserves, but I'm guessing it may be similar to those weird vanguard card or oversized commander cards.

Some of them may have and hold some value, but it won't have growth.

Also another consideration is the next batch of art cards probably will have a different gimmicky that would make it more attractive like real signatures or maybe something crazy like real pieces of the original artwork or some shit, so those printed signed ones will become less special.

Maybe in the future opinions on them shift for some strange reason and turn them more desirable to more people, but I see more downsides than upsides.",0.42069584,0.47042674,0.10887742,2.0,0.0

The scenario of covid forcing players to stop playing is so far away from players choosing not to continue a format that they no longer enjoy, I’m not even sure comparing the two is worth. 

Pioneer is d e d dead. There’s some chance people will flock back to a format they didn’t love over one they did, but that’s not something I’m counting on. 

The modern card pool is expensive because people are still buying and building decks using them, or aren’t selling because they plan to use them.

2155,2.0,"I see a bit of a risk hierarchy, that coupled with price and opportunity, may help make appropriately proportioned speculations...

**EDH + Modern Staples -** If a card is a Modern staple, and also excellent in EDH - I've kept it throughout 2020, and will continue to hold until paper play returns (risk of reprint may be high, but I'm largely ignoring that). 

* Force of Negation is one of the few cards I actively snagged as they bottomed, and a strong example card (with a high risk of MH2 reprinting unfortunately..)
* Other examples I've liked: Blood Moon, Eladamri's Call, Walking Ballista
* I see a trend in EDH toward higher comfort with powerful effects, with combos, with tutors, and with denial cards. There is still plenty of salt, but more and more players are becoming ok with a bit of well-seasoned hate.
* MH1 is still teeming with EDH + Modern cards worth a look

**Pioneer + Modern Staples** \- A rung down in the risk hierarchy are cards that are Modern staples and also excellent in Pioneer (and not too critical for EDH)  I don't have a clear picture yet on the best examples of this that are also good pick-ups, but Fatal Push and Thoughtseize are solid examples of the type of card. (just not sure the 2XM copies are a good buy or not). And Aether Gust is another example, but seems way too abundant already.

* The risk with these cards is buying too soon, just like the OP is highlighting
* By being both needed for Pioneer and Modern, these cards do have a bit of risk mitigation
* But really, the paper magic return is likely not right around the corner...

**Modern Exclusives** \- the highest risk category, and the one I'm staying away from for a bit longer. But damn wouldn't it be cool if Engineered Explosives became a $20 card or better? It's a terrible example, as the card has had several printings, and the meta, but still, it illustrates the dream and dangers does it not?",0.23179208,0.507879,0.26032898,13.0,0.0

• January 2018 (Energy, Ramunap Red)

While you correctly attribute the stability of Modern as a reason for its popularity post 2016, the instability and poor gameplay of Standard matters just as much, if not more. There’s not as much compelling reason to play a stable format if there’s a stable format that’s much less expensive and mostly as fun.  As an example, all the bannings in Modern have made it turning over multiple decks as costly as a couple of dual lands (the entry to Legacy) but Legacy itself has been not been entirely stable and free from the same nonsense Modern has so it’s not offering much for its high entry price.

2158,5.0,"I see a fair degree of migration from Modern towards Legacy and towards Pioneer, for different reasons.

Pioneer offers Modern players what a pecentage of modern players always wanted- what they might call a ""no bullshit"" format. A format where staples are pretty much easily accessible, where power level is relatively low, where a lot of decks are either aggro and if combo gets to be widely played -regardless of the results it puts up- it gets a visit from a Mr Ban Hammer esq. Combo is tolerated at the margins, and control is at the margins- they can be played,  but they are not good enough to make an evening of FNM a grind vs the equivalent of Snowko in Legacy. Prison- of any form- is almost non existant, outside of brewers building around a few key cards, and 90-10 % matchup lotteries are rare, unlike Modern, which has, from the very outset, always had the Soul Sister or Martyr proc vs Burn and Shoal Infect vs Tron type non matches.   It is also a format where the gap between lower tier and higher tier is smaller than Modern, very attractive to some, very samey to others. Nobody is going to claim Pioneer as their favourite format, but there have always been Modern players who \*hated\* Twin, for example, or Pod. Others have always hated 8 rack, Top control etc, and latterly Urza.  In fact, a fair portion of Modern's player base only played it because they saw Standard and wanted something different but could not comit to Legacy due to the prices. Remember fetches were cheap at the outset, and only shocks were truly expensive- it was a different era, one where some people starting off in the format moaned about Ensnaring Bridge, Blood Moon etc being legal right from the start. No format has been moaned about as much as Modern.  As a historically cheap entry point Pioneer it is the sort of format you can buy into without committing, and it will take some Modern players in paper, even if not online.

A small portion of Modern's base have seen the $$££ crash, and their collection value has been shat on, whilst the requirment for spending on new cards that might be banned has continued unabated. MH1 really upset players- Hoogy et al. They have seen the reprints, and been burned financially, whilst the format often burned as an experience.  Some of those players have been expressing interest in Legacy, where RL has kept prices high, but reprints have lowered other cards as in Modern. It is true that RL prices are now ludicrous, but Legacy offers a hugely enthusiastic community, increasingly running unsanction proxy events,  and some great decks are RL free and cheaper than ever, such as  D n T. Many old Legacy staples like Show and Tell have crashed via reprints, and with duals also usable in EDH, and Astrolabe working overtime in blue soup decks, £350 for a U sea or 120 for a  Savannah does not seem so bad. Cards like Tabernacle and Moat have a cache, but they are not essential for many decks. The last challenge had burn in second place- nigh on 20 mountains and good old fashioned burn spells, cheaper than the Modern version. In America, which has always had an emphasis on Legacy as a competitive tour experience , it might be different, but in Europe and Japan etc. Legacy is strong and attracting interest and strong sales, mainly becuase it has the best answers as a format and a community who are not as driven to play the best deck in paper mtg. 

It is in WOTC interest to make Pioneer work. I don't think they care either way about Modern and Legacy- MH2 added as much to both formats and like most sets had lots of EDH able stuff. If they had to chose one to keep it might be Modern, but given the grief they get over it, I think they will let them run their course. I would expect both formats to survive online, but in paper I think Legacy will be kept alive as a niche format by its community, whilst Modern will not.",,,,7.0,0.0
2159,6.0,"Agreed. There's just not much of an appeal to Modern now as a format or really constructed as whole. The big draw to Modern as an ""eternal"" format was that you'd put in the up-front cost of putting more into your deck than with Standard, but it would be viable for a longer period of time. That's just no longer the case. There's been such a drastic shift in power with new staples seemingly printed every other set the last two years. 

It's just not worth it to keep up any longer as player, especially if your deck is suddenly not viable in the current meta or worse gets banned out from under you. 

I'm going to keep the pieces I might be able to port over to Legacy or into my CMDR decks, but I have zero interest in keeping the majority of the ""staples"" I've collected over the past 5 years. My plan is to absolutely sell out of the vast majority of these to a GP vendor once those are viable again. 

I'd say the real moneymaker right now is anything EDH related. That stuff is not going anywhere in the near future and demand is just extremely high across the board.

I have a feeling WotC is going to want to crank up the Modern hype this year because MH2 is coming, but I'm not sure how they will do this. Probably the main thing that will sell MH2 is fans of Commander and this might be how they pivot the marketing angle. I don't think the set is going to do well because people don't have much confidence in Modern and there won't be enough Commander cards to make EDH players excited.

I hope this is the last MH set for awhile, and WotC backs off some. They saw how much they can make off of EDH, so maybe they will make 2022 another Year of Commander.

It could very well be this store has pulled something shady. I don't know. So, thanks for the heads-up that people may want to be wary.

However, as someone who has built/revised multiple online stores, let me tell you that integrating with inventory is not something most stores do very well. Often, their online systems and on-site true inventory system might only sync once a day...or might never sync, and online inventory quantities must be adjusted by hand (when they remember to). This is often a problem when stores list the same quantities on multiple platforms to increase exposure.

With these problems, it's very common for a sudden interest in a product to result in overselling. The inventory problem may not be discovered until they dig through their back orders. If they discover they've oversold, many stores will try to scrounge up spare inventory to fill the order and make you wait without saying anything. Very unprofessional, but in their anxiety they don't want to risk losing a sale by actually informing you of what's going on.

But again, I don't know what happened in your particular case. Just given what I've seen behind the scenes of a handful of stores though, I think inventory mismanagement is more often the cause of these problems rather than an attempt to profit more off of a spike.",0.7692981,0.21170151,0.01900044,11.0,0.0

I’m not an expert on this stuff though by any means so I’m sure there are tons of other variances and factors that can influence these things. I do have some examples though!

Look at [[jace, the mind sculptor]], then [[idyllic tutor]] or [[ugin, the spirit dragon]].

Worldwake jace has a premium over the several reprints, while each reprint is close to the same between them. This is usually just an availability thing though, and less available in general due to not being in a standard set, so already holds an extra premium due to the price of entry for the reprint sets. A lot less worldwake copies in the world compared to the other reprints, and most folks will usually just buy the reprint because it’s being offered for less than the original.

Morningtide idyllic tutor, and I would think most with different arts throughout its reprint history, has a premium over its standard reprint due to both supply and art, but the original price has dropped significantly since the reprint. It will never be close to the same price though because of the art.

Original ugin though has the same art as reprint ugin, and you see that in price as well. Very close to reprint price. Of course this doesn’t factor in the new bling versions and such. That’s a different discussion.

I don’t know enough to answer each question though, but thought I would share what I know at least. In general, time makes prices go down as demand for these things change to the newest set releases. So commander legends and associated reprints have a little time still. The biggest caveat to that is when a new big deal thing arrives that makes these other things gain renewed interest, and this new demand causes price to go up as supply goes down.

2247,8.0,"Let me start with the caveat that general trends may likely not apply to 2020 releases, but I'd still like to understand the general trend, as well as specific info on 2XM and other 2020 releases.

**General trends:** My understanding from reading this subreddit is that the *reprint versions of cards* (e.g. the 2XM version of \[\[Dark Confidant\]\]) are typically at their low during the first couple weeks of release (I guess because people are racing to the bottom to liquidate their initial box openings?), while *new cards* in regular print-run products usually are at their low when peak supply hits the market (post-allocation) and/or when rotation happens (unless it's a hot card in EDH).

However, I can't seem to find an answer regarding when the lows happen for *prior printings of reprinted cards* (e.g. the MMA printing of Dark Confidant, or even the RAV printing, depending on how artwork factors in). It seems like the price comes down more slowly for OG printings than they do for the reprint. True? What is the general timeframe for the best time to buy OG printings?

**Double Masters:** Looking at the price graphs on MTGStocks, it looks like a lot of the OG printings of the 2XM reprints are reaching their lows, based on the slight flattening I'm seeing after the decline. For example, Dark Confidant experienced a steady decline since July when it was around $45-$50, until it reached $30 around the beginning of December, where it has remained flat since.

That said, I don't fully trust those graphs. Do you guys feel like 2XM reprints have hit their lows? Or is the recent wave of holiday VIPs going to push them even lower now? I'd love feedback from anyone who has sales data to confirm (or contradict) what the graphs seem to be indicating!

**Other 2020 releases:** Of the other releases this year, which of them have reached their lows and which am I too late on?

Or I guess the first question is.... which actually had a significant enough impact on prices? Neither Mystery Booster, Jumpstart, nor The List seemed to have had much impact on prices of OG printings, though there's some exceptions (such as \[\[Selvala, Heart of the Wilds\]\], which was around $40 and is now sub-$20). The ones I've homed in on are:

* THB - \[\[Idyllic Tutor\]\]
* C20 - a half dozen or so cards, notably \[\[The Locust God\]\]
* M21 - a good half dozen cards, notably Ugin and Azusa
* ZNR - \[\[Lotus Cobra\]\]
   * In the commander decks, Omnath, Sygg, and Oona

What about Commander Legends? Has it been out long enough? I'd love to pick up Lorwyn copies of \[\[Rings of Brighthearth\]\]!

What about CC: Green? Is it a limited enough product to not have much impact on OG printings?",,,,14.0,1.0

2249,0.0,"If you're interested in finding premium versions of cards for your deck, there are a few ways to do it.  If you're willing wait a while before completing your deck, I'd recommend picking up cards as they get reprinted.  If a chunk of your deck got reprinted in 2XM, now is a great time to pick those cards up.  If the last time a card was reprinted was back in MM17, I'd probably hold off on it.

I've read through every single post in this topic but no one addresses the actual issue here.  I don't mind paying taxes on my actual profit.  I mean, it sucks and we're already far too heavily taxed for my personal beliefs, but that's a different topic entirely.  What I *DO* mind is paying taxes on gross revenue and not just profit.  The problem with this new change in tax reporting isn't that people are going to be forced to pay tax on their profit, it's that the VAST majority of people aren't going to have a way to prove their cost basis and are going to be taxed to the fullest extent on the entire sale price.  When Joe Blow sells his decade old shoes or clothing or whatever else from around the house on ebay, how is he expected to deduct the purchase price of those goods from what eBay is now saying he ""made""?  Chances are he's losing money overall and simply recouping those costs, but the vast majority of us aren't going to have receipts for the shit we've bought.  Do you have receipts for all of the cards in your collection?  Did you save your walmart, target or LGS receipts for the random 10 packs you bought where you cracked a 50 dollar card that's currently sitting in your binder that you'll maybe sell a couple years from now?  That card wasn't free, but how are you going to prove to the IRS that it wasn't free?  THAT'S the problem with this.  It completely FUCKS OVER common folk and helps the corporations that already have their ducks in a row.

2296,28.0,"To follow up on my last post.  Does anyone have any actual solutions to this?  I'm open-minded and all ears.  I'd like to continue selling online and I'll pay my tax on profit, just not on revenue.  How can us every day folk possibly and realistically comply with this?  

Lets say I buy a collection of 100 cards for $100.  Lets say I keep some of that collection for my own purposes because those are the cards I wanted, and I sell $75 worth of cards from the collection to recoup the cost of said collection.  Like most collections, the cards will be variable value.  Some of those cards might be worth 5 cents, others 5 bucks, and others 20 bucks.  How the hell do I possibly report this where I'm not paying tax since I'm not actually making a profit?  And before you say ""your cost basis for every individual card is $1, so you pay taxes on each card you sell for over $1"", no, you're wrong.  In this instance I spent $100 and sold $75 worth.  I'm not making a profit and haven't made a profit.  

And that previous example is an incredibly basic example.  What about a huge collection of thousands of cards?  What about cards you pull from packs?  What about cards you currently have in your collection already that you've had for years or decades that you couldn't possibly provide a cost basis for?

2442,3.0,"I would recommend selling fetches now if you don't plan on using them in the near term.  As Rudy would say, you have to look at the odds on both sides.

The odds of expedition fetches going UP in the next 6 months is very minimal.  Zendikar Rising is still in print.  Box Toppers come with every box.  Collector Boosters come with an average of 4, and are still available for $184 even 7 
months after release.  So you have ample supply in the market, with distributors still having plenty in stock.  This puts an effective ceiling on some of these prices.

Then you have MH2 coming along on top of ZNR with fetches at Rare.  While product prices are higher, distributor checks show supply is decent - at least they are allowing a good amount of pre-orders right now.  We also have 4 product variants of MH2 this year (Bundles, Collector Boxes, Set Boxes, and Draft Boxes) as opposed to just 1 in MH1.  A lot of this product will be opened even at higher prices.  A lot of fetches will be fetched.

These factors make it difficult for fetches to appreciate significantly in the near term.  There is a bigger risk they will fall, perhaps significantly.  Keep in mind Polluted Delta dropped down to $13 with buylists under $10 back in 2015 and Khans, and even last year you could find copies under $20 in ebay auctions.  We've only recently seen spikes towards $40 and as with many other recent spikes, does not appear to be sustainable - arbitrage will begin to kick in and lead stores to crack more boxes to fill the demand at these inflated prices.  

The original expeditions still reign king, so they may survive this assuming MH2 doesn't introduce some sort of super bling, ultra rare version that takes over.

Probably a common issue on here, but I recently picked up a box of Modern Horizons to sit on for a while ahead of MH2s release this July, and when it arrived from Amazon it was pretty beat up.

Of course, the didn't ship it in anything protective, just a loose brown mailer. As a result, there are a few rips in the plastic and dents in the box, including one corner rip that is significant. Should I be concerned that the value of the box is affected by these rips, as it looks like it could have been resealed?

To be clear - I don't believe it is resealed or searched. Even the corner rip would be pretty hard to get the packs out of without warping or ripping further. If this had a box topper, I'd be very concerned.

That said I have some expierence buying and selling alters and one thing I can tell you is that alters prices are totally subjective to the artists. The only factor that can help determine minimum price is the card's price by itself and alters usually go for more than their price. The price over the card's price covers for materials and time spent so a lot of the times the more is painted, the more it costs.

In general if you like the alter just buy it. There's no additional finicial advice since you're very unlikely to resell it later. You could also contact an artist for a commision of your choice which gives you control over how it looks but may look different due to paintes tecnhique and price can also be higher or lower.

TL:DR - There is nothing really to think about alters in terms of finance. If you feel you can spend some money on unsellable art piece on your card then go for it if not then don't.",0.29539812,0.6120725,0.09252943,2.0,0.0

Contemporary cards look very convincing in sleeves, but old border cards, especially duals, are amongst the worst counterfeits.

Now there’s nothing stopping a seller from shipping you a counterfeit while having used pictures of a real card for the listing, and for that reason I would avoid low-feedback sellers.
