- The chase for yield is a global issue but a relative concept. If you are a Japanese investor 3% is high yield for you, but not in Australia, so at which level do you define high yield?  
- It's a supply/demand issue as well. There is a lot of cash chasing the same bonds, so limited supply, a lot of demand, which is contributing to spread compression, contributing to returns. Carry is a thing.  Cost of missing out on Carry when you are benchmarked can be quite big.  
- One of the ratings criteria to be Investment Grade is size, for a few Industries, Moody's and S&P are requiring a minimum size before a company can be IG. So you can have a company with good cash flow ratios but not meeting all the IG requirements, so stuck artificially in the HY space (Fresenius used to be like that). Being in the healthcare sector, highly cash flow generative but too small to be IG, even if treasuries went up, most of their bonds being with fixed coupon, I have no issue with them being HY.

People on the short side of the CDSs received monthly cash in flows representing mortgage payments but I don't think a lot of people on the short side had any idea they were providing insurance if the underlying went bust. This is what wiped out a lot of pentions.

It's not that the CDSs paid 6 times the notional value of the bonds, it's that there were 6 CDSs for every MBS. That's probably not the best way of saying it though. You didn't need to own the MBS in order to take out an insurance policy on it. Seems counterintuitive as you can't buy insurance on a car you don't own. But this could be a good example.

Imagine you could buy insurance on someone else's car and you and all of your friends know that Jim is a terrible driver. You all somehow buy insurance on his car because you know that the insurance company is severely understating the risk. They are charging him as if there is a 5% chance he will get into an accident but you know there is nearly a 100% chance. So now when Jim totals his car the insurance company has to pay Jim and all of you for the damages. That is how there were so many more CDSs than MBSs. There's a great quote from the movie by Jared Vennet ""I'm standing in front of a burning building and I'm offering you fire insurance on it.""

I think what Eisman was saying was that the synthetic CDOs were effectively a substitute, or perhaps better said, were a functional substitute for the ""regular"" CDOs, because they provided a volume of financial instruments for the CDO manager to charge a fee against. 

While diversification reduces risk, they key point made by Lewis (among others) is that the actual risk was misstated. 

According to the ISDA, the notional value of CDS at the end of 2007 was about $62 trillion.

I know that this is not my primary field of expertise, but I can't quite understand how one justifies having $10.1 trillion in assets insured for $62 trillion. Someone with a principal residence worth $400,000 couldn't get an insurance policy that would pay out 6 times that amount; the insurer would pay what it took to rebuild your house (or some variation on that).

54,0.0,"These aren't ETFs, they're closed end funds. The reason they took a shit this year is because of the structure of their leverage.

Coming in to the year we saw a broad selloff in fixed income driven by a rise in treasury rates. Because the fund owns a leveraged portfolio of long term munis, it has a pretty long duration. That more or less explains the drop in price until about February. The reason the fund hasn't recover since then despite long term rates stabilizing is that the spread between the yields of the bonds in the portfolio and the cost of the line of credit used to leverage the portfolio has narrowed due to the flattening yield curve. When you aren't making as much money from that spread, the leverage essentially adds interest rate risk without really adding to return. CEFs generally have to delever in that scenario, which forces them to sell portfolio assets in a declining liquidity environment. That's a major reason why the discount has widened, because market participants recognize that this is a terrible environment for a closed end muni fund.

I'm not as concerned about another big drawdown in longer term bonds from a rate spike, but I'd have real trouble buying a muni closed end with the yield curve this flat. I expect the discount to continue to widen, and your total return will probably be worse than buying a vanilla muni ETF.

Duration can differ from ultra-short (a few months to a year), short (up to 2.5 years), intermediate (up to 10), and long

if you are buying a bond fund, then the average duration of each bond might be lower than the maturity of each bond they buy - they might buy 10 year bonds, but the average for the fund is 5 years because they're already holding some bonds for many years now

Credit rating can be from AAA to C (D is for in default). Junk bonds are often unrated.

Floating rate bank loans are generally equivalent to junk ultra-short bonds, since their duration is 3 months and they're not safe in a recession.

I am a 70 yr old retiree, have no concerns about amassing or leaving a valued estate, just want to live as well as I can, and die broke.

and put majority of it into a managed portfolio > 60% in a fixed income fund (for income and safety) 40% equity funds for growth and inflation hedge. 
Pretty straightforward textbook stuff, where I don't have to be active or smart.
And it's been OK, I take a fixed sum out every month for me.

Now I am looking at my situation of being 60% in bonds at a time when interest rates are expected to rise.
Not good; rising rates >> decreased bond prices. My future value looks bleak as (60% of) my capital erodes. 
Sorta like the miracle of compound interest in reverse.
Just to be clear, I'm comfortable with the 40% in equities, it suits my positive outlook. 
My issue is with the 60% in fixed income; thinking it would be better in cash, 
which may seem dead (limited to term deposit minimal rates), but is not subject to loss. 

Think about it for a day or two, and slap myself upside the head:
""self, you dummy, the future value of my bonds is *NOT* a function of market volatility in the secondary bond market, 
but *IS* predetermined by the maturity value of the bonds"" SLAP ""capice?"" 
self: ""duh, yeah, OK, sorry for being so stupid"".

Another day, another thought: ""Well, it would be ok if I directly owned bonds and reinvested them at maturity, getting cheaper bonds (higher yields);

and *IS* subject to market volatility, and is likely to decrease with rising interest rates.""

1) no

2) see above

3) The note you are looking at and/or its derivatives and/or the tender offer has some component of it based on the conditions of another totally separate security. Similar to how one's home mortgage rate might be based on the LIBOR rate for example - as LIBOR changes your mortgage payment may change. In the case of these notes you are asking about, their reference security appear to all be treasuries you will need to look at the details of the note to see what and how they utilize the reference security. Fixed spread (bps) are basis points above another interest rate the note is using.

4) No. They will give you $30 extra for every $1000 aggregate principal. 

5) Your questions are misguided at this point. And your math on calculating bond value is also wrong. $1000 of par value and $1000 of current fair market value are different things. Are these $1000 par value notes currently trading for $500, $1000 or $2000 etc? Par value and market value are different. 

Also ""But with current low interest environment bond value will go up if the company is a safe company."" is not exactly correct, talking about two different things. There is credit risk and there is interest rate risk (duration risk), they are connected but different risks.

1) 7.95% notes due 2026 bond have 180M outstanding and ""Principal Amount Tendered"" = 46.7M . They only want to buyback 46.7 out of the 180?

2) If yes to (1), why not just buyback completely 7.95% notes due 2026 or 7.70% notes due 2026 since the mature date/ interest are about the same and deal with less one outstanding note?

3) whats ""Reference Security"" and ""Fixed Spread (bps)"" on the site means?

4) ""The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes"" If i sell them back $1000 they will give me $1030 ?

""So just take a ratio of LQD/IEF – this will tell you what bond traders think of the economy. When they disagree seriously with equity/stock traders, the bond traders are right, and early.""

""Want to understand our economy's health? Forget employment, trade wars, consumer confidence, yield curves, or price of oil. There's ONE KEY VARIABLE. In a HEALTHY economy, US 10-year yields should be INCREASING. They recently bounced off 1-year LOWS. ANYTHING ELSE IS NOISE.""

""To clarify, if our economy were healthy, companies would be looking to the future positively, borrowing money in anticipation of increased economic activity, and so bidding up long-term interest rates. US 10Y yields recently hit 1-year lows; Japan & Germany, 2-year lows.""

Now what I'm unclear on is if the -trend- is what matters, or the absolute position of these values.

Basically, 10 year treasuries being sold down mean we've been bullish for a while, but they are about to start increasing now because they bounced off the bottom?

Also, looking at IEF, it doesn't show a clear downward trend, so I'm trying to get an idea of how this ratio works since the chart doesn't show the yield - just the current value/return I think.

Because bonds have moved up so fast the last few months I would be hesitant to buy even treasuries but I can't predict the future so if the world goes to hell then today's prices might be a bargain.

I use Fidelity and trade bonds there. There's great liquidity for high grade bonds but here will diminished liquidity for bonds close to speculative grade as the economy weakens.

However, if some of these are what you want then here's how I'd start. First check the call dates. I do not want to pay up (over par) if the bond has a chance of being called. If interest rates continue downward some of these may be called and re-financed.

Check the company's debt and asset ratios.

Check the liquidity of recent trades (Fidelity has a link on the bond info page.)

Check Moody's (free) or S&P (Fidelity) to see if any of these are on watch for downgrades.

For example, I can see you looked at Ford. The outlook is negative for them making them a speculative plus you have to pay a lot of extra principal up front.

Now the value will go down if you try to sell them;

In way over simplified example lets say you have a $100 1 year bond paying 1%. After a year you will get $1 in interest and $100 principal back

The FED raises rates and now you can buy a $100 1 year bond yielding 2%.

No one is going to pay $100 for your bond if you try to sell it for $100. Why would they pay $100 for your 1% bond when they can buy a new bond for $100 that pays 2%?

So your bond will continue to pay 1%, and if you hold it nothing happens . However if you want to sell it, you will have to drop the price and it will sell for $99. This now gives the buyer the same return as the new bonds

If they buy a $100 year bond at 2% after 1 year they will have made $2

If they buy your bond for 99 after 1 year they will get 100 back and $1 interest and made $2

So if you think rates are going to go up, the best thing to do is hold short term bonds , you can keep rolling them over in 6-12 months for new bonds paying higher interest.

I doubt that treasuries will lose value under the current admin from interest rate rises.

200,0.0,"The only time that yield to worst and yield to maturity are not the same is if the bond has an embedded option.

Say a bond with an embedded call (i.e. the issuer has the right but not the obligation to call the bond at par ($100) on or after the call date which is prior to maturity) is trading at a large premium, say $125. If the bond is callable at $100 tomorrow, your return if the bond were in fact called would be very negative if you bought the bond today at $125. So the yield to _worst_ at the $125 price would be ~-20% ((125 - 100) / 125). 

However if the issuer decided not to call the bond (because, say interest rates are higher now then when they issued the bond and so they’d prefer to keep paying the lower coupon rather than calling, reissuing, and paying a higher coupon), your yield to _maturity_ would be the typical yield measure for a non-callable bond (i.e. the yield resulting from your return of principal and interest over the life of the bond).
 
So YTW <= YTM in all cases. And if they’re equal, the bond doesn’t have an embedded option (an option free bond is called a “bullet”).

While you’re close to correct in saying YTM is guaranteed, YTM assumes reinvestment of coupons at the same YTM at which the bond is purchased. So if rates go down and you have to reinvest coupons at lower yields, you would earn marginally less than the YTM at which you bought.

It means a bond is now trading to a shorter maturity, because a call feature permits an issuer to retire or refinance a bond at a date that is prior to the stated maturity of the bond, usually at a call premium to the typical par/100 cents maturity price. The implication for the bondholder is that the convexity is limited in the bond, meaning the price upside in the bond is limited and price becomes tethered to that call premium. It also means that the company can usually refinance the bond for a lower coupon than the bond that is being replaced, which usually happens either because overall market rates have fallen materially, or because the issuer of the bond has experienced a reduction in credit risk (usually because cash flow has improved) and credit spread permitting the refinancing of the bond for a better credit spread to risk free rates and a better all-in rate. Assuming a bondholder wants to remain invested in bonds, the holder will have to redeploy those funds after the bond is taken out, and that would usually be at rates below where they were previously invested, either because the market rate has fallen, or because this issuer’s bonds or similar bonds now trade with lower rates and spreads.

270,6.0,"New to bonds, but I just finished reading The Bond Book by Annette Thau. It was tremendously helpful, particularly the chapter on Bond Funds vs Bonds. It got me thinking about the 40% bonds in the portfolio. I haven’t been able to find the origins on the 60/40 rule, but it seem to have originated well before Bond Funds even existed. Index funds and Bond Funds didn’t originate until 1976 and modern portfolio theory dates to 1952. This makes me think the original intention of the 60/40 rule expected investors to be purchasing individual bonds, not Bond Funds. Most everyone (myself included) are using Bond Funds for the 40% bonds. The problem with this approach is they aren’t actually Bonds, they are Funds of Bonds. This means they lose value when yields rise, and the change in value affects the value of a portfolio. If people invested in laddered bonds they wouldn’t be affected by changes in yield because they would still be receiving their coupon and would also receive the par value. Then when they purchase the next step in their ladder they would get a higher yield, so it would be a good thing. I think the use of Bond Funds have been to our advantage over the past 30-40 years, since yields have fallen much more than they’ve increased. Looking forward, yields can’t go much lower, at some point they have to head up (maybe not my lifetime, but someday.)

356,0.0," You want to calculate the interest on $25 at 1.68% interest per year after 5 year(s).

The formula we'll use for this is the simple interest formula, or:

Where:  


* **P** is the principal amount, $25.00.  

* **r** is the interest rate, 1.68% per year, or in decimal form, 1.68/100=0.0168.  

* **t** is the time involved, 5....year(s) time periods.  

* So, **t** is 5....year time periods.  


To find the simple interest, we multiply 25 × 0.0168 × 5 to get that:

The interest is: $2.10

Usually now, the interest is added onto the principal to figure some new amount after 5 year(s),  
or 25.00 + 2.10 = 27.10. For example:

* If you borrowed the $25.00, you would now owe $27.10
* If you loaned someone $25.00, you would now be due $27.10
* If owned something, like a $25.00 bond, it would be worth $27.10 now.",0.17331319,0.757274,0.06941279,2.0,0.0
