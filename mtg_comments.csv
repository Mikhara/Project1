0,"I doubt fetches will be in Ema.  Fetches are a big fat rain check for WOTC to sell any set they want.  Ema has no end to the amount of otherwise difficult reprints for WOTC to pick from.  Although I expect a few bones for modern I don't expect any of the major selling points of the set to be modern staples.  (Maybe chalice)

I'd expect them in conspiracy before Ema tbh.  Something to sell the casual set to spikes would be ideal for them.",24,0
1,i would say not even close to the amount dropped before since khans was opened so much and EMA will not be opened as much being it is a very limited print run.,4,0
2,"I wouldn't be shocked if they held constant, or even went up. EMA will have a tiny print run and fetches being in the set would be confirmation that they aren't getting a reprint anywhere else anytime soon. The belief that they'll be reprinted soon is probably keeping the price down to some degree.",10,0
3,"EMA's print run is too small to affect the overall long term value of the Zendikar fetches.

For Zendikar fetchlands to actually take a value/price hit, it needs to be printed in a Standard legal set like how Onslaught fetches were reprinted in KTK and Fate Reforged.

Even if they are reprinted in a Modern Masters set, nothing is going to change much with regards to the price/value.",2,0
4,"IMO, they wont reprint Zendikar fetches in standard. The only reason they reprinted the ONS ones in standard was to make them modern legal. They have stated this a few times. I do think that they will probably wait until the next MM set because, where else? EMA will not have them because theyre modern legal and they stated a majority wont be modern legal.",2,0
5,"Why is this even a conversation to have? 

The chances of fetches being in EMA is approximately zero. 

We've already been told that while there will be some modern-legal cards in EMA, the emphasis and vast majority will be non-modern-legal eternal cards. 

EMA is going to sell itself even if it's Force of Will, Wasteland and Grisly Bear as the only 3 cards in the set. Fetches, by themselves, sell sets. WotC won't reprint them outside of a Standard expansion because it's literally setting money on fire. ON FIRE. ",4,0

1,"Definitely seems like it could be a good card but I think people are overrating it a bit.

From the finance side, I would never buy an in print rare for $20, just ask all the people who got burned by Hangarback Walker (which is played in more than Standard).

The best in print rares are cards that will see play in other formats, and lately the most recent case of that has been the fetches. Polluted Delta is the best fetch from KTK in terms of universal use and it's still selling for like $15-16 right now. There is no way Westvale Abbey will end up costing more than Polluted Delta longterm.

Finally, currently Westvale Abbey is at $10 or $35 for a playset of 4 via ebay or TCGPlayer. [Here is a screenshot of the listings.](http://imgur.com/RJy2zjS) Can't just trust the blue number above a card for its ""value"" -- you should look at what it actually sells for.",10,0
2,is it really a spike when the card isn't out yet?,5,0
3,"Westvale abbey is a rare, but the ratios of double faced rares/mythics in the set (as they replace a common) is roughly 1:8 packs according to Maro. This means we can compare it closer to mythic baseline pricing than rare pricing and these will be harder to pull than other rares in the set.

With this in mind, the price might stick, and the ceiling is more uncertain. Buy in if you need them in the first couple weeks, but if you can afford to wait that's not a bad idea.",3,0
4,"I picked this as one of the few sleepers in the set, but $20 each is way too high. It's a solid standard card with 2 archetypes in modern that will make use of it, but $20 is where I expected the foil price to end up.

There's two problems with the $20 price point. The first problem is that we haven't seen the supply actually hit the market. There's going to be a massive surge in supply in two weeks, and that's going to create a ton of downward pressure on every card in the set. 

The second problem is playability. This isn't like cavern of souls, where it can shoehorn into any deck running creatures. Nor is it wrath protection, at least not in standard (modern elves can reliably activate this card by turn 3). It's going to take a tier 0 standard list, or multiple tier 1 lists to sustain that particular price point.",1,0
5,ug i had 4 in my cart yesterday that i forgot to purchase.  It was at 6.00.  But its just a rare; not mythic so $20 is unsustainable.,1,0
6,How often do people need to be told that unless you are playing a big event in week 1 it isn't necessary and prices will drop. Hopefully you didn't squander money or if you did it is not that big of a loss. But in all honesty just wait the 2 weeks before you pick up your cards. ,1,0

1,"""Variance Incarnate"" is not a fair card since you can cast it when you are dead on board. If you choose to cast this card only in response to losing situations you will only lose half of the ""dead on board"" games.  

Say a matchup is even at 0.5:0.5 and you hold that card. In case you win, you will never cast it, in case you lose, you cast it and can win the lost game with probability 50%. Your new win chance is 0.5 + 0.5*0.5 = 0.75.  

Or more generalized: Say you hold that card and your winning probabilty without playing it is p. Your winning probability when playing this card in response to the game losing move is p* = p + (1-p)*0.5 = 0.5p + 0.5 which is greater or equal to p.",5,0

4,"Pretty well nailed it, Corbin. Only thing I would add is that getting rid of Tron's best tool for beating up on nonlinear decks will likely decrease the linearity of the format overall, which seems like something that most Modern players want. When all nonlinear decks--be they a traditional Control deck or mid-range decks like BGx--get rid of the their common worst match-up, we have a format that no longer actively punishes decks for not being as linear as possible.

0,"B&R with SOI will impact your Opals significantly if it's on the chopping block, but the rest of the deck will soften much slower, so you're not at super high risk.  

That said, I would consider building D&T in phases. Pick up the cheap stuff now, like the sideboard Containment Priest or Council's Judgments, and the main board Flickerwisps, Ethersworn Canonists, etc. What you want to get ahead of is a rush for staple cards that are not reprinted, which thankfully for D&T is the cheaper stuff.

Wastelands are in EMA as we all know, and most likely Rishadan Ports will be in. Karakas should be, so you can wait on those until EMA hits. You can gamble on Stoneforge, but you won't lose much if they're reprinted as prices are soft right now anyway (I got a set of normal ones at $16/each).",8,0

3,Why not move into legacy affinity? ,2,0
4,"It seems unlikely that Opal will get banned at this checkpoint. ""Shakeup"" bans are typically reserved for January and the Pro Tour. Beyond that, Affinity hasn't crushed the format the way that Eldrazi did, so there's no power level need. Considering that Modern is *too* shaken up right now, I doubt that they'll pass on seeing the post-Twin meta they expected to have in February. ",2,0
5,"Wait till EMA comes out.  You can buy most of the more recent cards in the deck but for everything else wait.  If port or karakas gets reprinted they will plummet in price.  A good chunk of the deck is fairly cheap and can easily be picked up.  I would wait on stoneforges though because regardless of if they get reprinted or not their price is only going down.  

I would not worry about a mox opal banning, thats like worrying about goblin guide being banned.  ",2,0
6,"As I understand it, there will not be a banned/restricted announcement when EMA is released. Thus, the only opportunity for [[Mox Opal]] to get banned before EMA release would be when they do the SOI B&R update, which is this monday IIRC.",2,0
7,"If you're sure you want to get out of Affinity, why not sell the opals now and just proxy your legacy until EMA?  It's a couple month's down time but you can spend that testing D&T to make sure you like it before you drop the big cash.",1,0
8,"To give some background I am trying to move out of Affinity and get into Death and Taxes. My concern is that if I sell now and buy now, the cards I buy will get reprinted in Eternal Masters. If I wait until Eternal Masters and Mox Opal gets banned, my deck is suddenly worth much less. Also, the cards that are expensive may not get reprinted, sending the price even higher. Just curious to get your guys opinion on what I should do. Feeling like waiting til EMA but that might not be right.",3,1
9,Out of Modern into Legacy. Wait or invest now?,3,2
0,The players in Japan understand the value of their foils and the cards are priced as such. There is no arbitrage opportunity here  ,13,0
1,From what I noticed while in Japan almost all the shops know how much value their foils are abroad. I don't think you will be able to pick up very many great deals,5,0
2,"The real sweet spot to pick up cards was last summer when the yen was extremely weak. We're now back to around 110 yen per dollar from the 2015 125 yen per dollar. 

That being said, I know it's impossible to go back in time and maximize your friend's money. 

Japanese stores know that Japanese cards/foils are more expensive than their English counterparts. As such, they will price it accordingly. To make things worse, trading is not allowed at big stores such as Hareruya (and I believe Yellow Submarine, not sure).

""Do I just get him a list of the 500 most expensive cards since Urza's Legacy and have him start sucking up Japanese foils of those?"" Pretty bad idea. In fact, you could probably find cheaper japanese foils of those cards on Ebay rather than through the stores. Your friend is going to have to really dig through the small stores of Akihabara that don't regularly check their prices to find any real deals and the time invested in that will not be worth it. 

""Sealed Product?"" Not recommended either. I thought this was a decent idea myself back when I visited Japan. I bought a few boxes of khans and origins thinking I could bring it back to the states with me. After all, booster boxes were $83 and I could realistically sell them for $120 right? Well, when you consider shipping, it automatically loses you money. Not only do you have to ship it to the states from Japan internationally, you also have to send it out to your buyer in the states. All in all, I found out that it lost me money and just took it back home with me to draft with my friends (have to mention that it took up a shit ton of my luggage weight)

""Get him a list of Legacy and EDH staples and tell him to look for foils of those?"" While I'm not so sure about Legacy staples, I think this is the best idea. EDH is not the super popular casual format like it is here. This results in EDH-only cards being priced rather cheaply. I remember buying Minamo, School at water's edge (a $25 card) for 1300 yen (about $11) on Hareruya. I don't have too much information regarding Legacy but I do know that Legacy is a thriving format in Japan so I would expect the cards to be priced pretty high.

If you remember, Birthing Pod got banned specifically due to the fact that Rhino Pod just broke the format in half.  We can play the same effective deck with Eldritch Evolution instead of Pod and already be very successful without risking completely dead hands.

While Allosaurus Rider combos might be cute, you're trying to justify a really bad card being a critical piece of a combo so that you can cheat huge creatures into play, something that is already inconsistent and done better in other decks that can dig for multiple pieces as needed anyway.

This can see play in modern elves (it's an elf, it's a combo), any post-pod-variant and has the potential to combo out new and exciting brokenness as early as turn 2 on the play with a mana dork.  

Allosaurus Rider will evolve into Grislbrand, Void Winnower, Iona, Elesh Norn, all of the ""Bringers"", and Inkwell Leviathan.

In a Naya-based fatties deck with Nahiri, this could be a string cheese piece, which gives you an extra avenue to victory.  In reality, this is just a card that's likely to entice Timmy-Johnny players to play some fun, but bad, combo deck and has short term spec opportunity.

I would say this spec has some potential. In Europe (mkm) we had 1400 copies this morning, and now there are only 475 left, so I would say it says a lot.

Turning a strong Control card into a win-con smells like upside. Yes a Nahiri can spoil the party, but Nahiri is not that common in Standard where the combo is at the right power-level.

5,"I know the thread asks about EMN, but right now you would be better off trying to spec from OGW/SOI than from preorders.  

Preorder prices are always inflated, and for every Jace VP there are 9 Day's Undoing. Sure, a couple cards are going to spike from their preorder price, but trying to pick against these odds is not a sound financial decision. Remember that these preorder prices are mostly set by large retailers such as SCG, who have had many years of experience evaluating and pricing cards. If they set the preorder price of a card to be 5$, you better believe that they are pricing it in such a way to maximize their profit.  

The reason why I would suggest looking at cards from OGW/SOI is because they are at a relative low point during their standard tenure. OGW/BFZ aren't being opened in Limited anymore, and SOI will soon only be opened as a 1x. Even if you whiff on a spec from these sets, you still are unlikely to suffer a huge devaluation until rotation.  

However, the best place to spec right now is on Modern cards with low print runs that can ride the hype train after something gets spoiled. This is far more difficult to do, but the profits are real. Yesterday Allosaurus Rider was a bulk rare that was sitting as low as it would likely ever get. Today it is sitting in double digits because a new card was spoiled, the hype train blew its fucking top, and everybody raced to attempt to make a profit. All on a combo that is very likely to be unplayable.  

TLDR: Unless you are the Warren Buffet of preorder specs, it is not financially advisable to buy into preorders. For maximum profit, find cheap, low print Modern cards that can now see hype due to new spoilers. ",2,0

4,"Most people don't like buying whole decks since they typically have a bunch of the cheap cards and a few of the bigger cards if they want to build a deck.  So it's hard to get someone to buy more than they need.  And if you're looking to get anywhere near TCG mid (or even low) it's even harder.  

I'd say if you're selling cards in bulk, you'll need to give a bulk discount and sell for 20-30% off TCG low (for anything over $5) and you'll find a buyer who's willing to get the cards they need as well as put in the time himself to sell/trade off the cards they don't need since the discount makes people more inclined to put in the work you don't want to do.

5,"It depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Are you looking for ease of sale or max profit?

If you are looking for max profit, then your best bet would be in the Magic Buy/Sell/Trade group on FB as there are decks going up there on the frequent though recently there have been a few Affinity decks up there in the last few months so there might be a bit of ""burn out."" I would advise not selling an Affinity list on eBay as it would be extremely easy for the buyer to complain about the product for any number of reasons and at that point you are looking at some form of refund.

If you are looking for ease of sale then I would suggest against an LGS unless they would pay well for the entire deck and rather sell it at a GP or an SCG event in your area. While you won't get paid particularly well things like the Vault Skirg (unless they are foil) and other ""low end un/commons"" you'll still get paid fairly well for the rest of the cards and will be able to dump the entire thing. If you do your research ahead of time, you can even find a list of the vendors at those events and check their buylist and have the amounts setup to max out on profit as you'll be able to pit dealers against each other's buy prices or just piece the deck out to vendors around the room and walk away with 0 cards and decent amount of cash.",1,0

Pauper is also growing. Most players I know won't have enough cash to buy a whole constructed deck but they will have cash on hand to buy most competitive pauper decks. I've devoted more time in building good pauper decks and I've been able to sell a few for quick cash. That's my advice. ",-3,0

However, their upside is severely limited by the sheer volume of cards printed these days... it will likely take years for the price to bounce off of the bottom after rotation. Look at Thoughtseize from Theros, which sees play in multiple Modern and Legacy decks, had a lower print run than BFZ, and is still dropping after it's rotation. After the current standard rotates, I think that a lot of cards will hit crazy low prices. ",3,0
2,"Long term these cards may very well be valuable, but there are several factors working against them right now.  Meaning short term their prices are likely to drop.

Set was massively opened due to expeditions.

They are still in standard and that means people will hold onto their copies until rotation, even if they aren't being played.

The legacy version is still partially hyped.  It hasn't proven itself.

Modern eldrazi has kinda proven itself but it's not super popular and lots could change there as modern still adjusts. For better or worse though.

The best time to pick up these cards will be at/post rotation.  Then anyone who was holding onto to them for standard will get rid of them cause they won't need them and we'll have another 9 months to see of eldrazi really is a big deal in modern or legacy.

I'm wondering what everyone's take on the long term value of Eldrazi cards are -- namely Thought-knot / Reality Smasher -- both of which are archetype staples in Legacy/Modern. To a lesser extent, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, Mimic and Endless One that also appear in Modern/Legacy to a still significant degree.

To me, Reality Smasher at $4 is severely underpriced and Thought-knot at ~$7 is also very underpriced. I feel like the other Eldrazi staples are underpriced as well, namely Endless one, Mimic, Reshaper, even Endbringer.

Just wondering what will happen to their card value upon rotation in ~ a year since they see significant play outside of standard.

Just because your digital Tarmogoyf once held a price tag of 50, does not mean it will always be so. The price tag of non-redeemable staples is heavily driven by constructed demand. If the incentives to play in constructed leagues disappear, these cards will begin to lose value.

If the new changes to MTGO go through, the economy will have to adjust to the fact that your cards are always in print, and that events have prohibitive amounts of rake.

I can't blame constructed players for wanting to sell out of MTGO right now. I don't think it's a terrible decision given the direction the program is going",15,0
1,"Today is an especially poor day to start investing in Modern staples on MTGO.  The writing on the wall seems clear to me: MTGO will, in the long-term, move from its current model to one more similar to Hearthstone and other CCGs.  They are very actively working toward the goal of divorcing the online economy from the paper one-- they have significantly reduced the redemption window, they have set it up so that redemption windows do not overlap but rather end at the same time, and have shifted the prize support from paying you in redeemable cards to paying you more in non-redeemable cards.  It is rather likely that within a couple years, they will end redemption entirely.  As a redemption window closes and a new set releases, they will simply announce that the new set wont be available for redemption and that will be that.

I think all of these modern cards will lose 90%+ of their value in this transition-- WotC has no reason not to 'reprint' them as prizes en masse if it means that they can get away with offering fewer redeemable cards as prizes.  In fact, if the complaints about ""treasure chests = cutting prize support"" find any traction with WotC, expect them to respond by *increasing* reprints of these older cards, sweetening the deal so to speak by offering more Force of Wills in your chests.  And people will not cry for the guy holding on to 100 copies of two-dollar Tarmogoyfs because in the new model they'll have two-dollar online drafts (not to mention two-dollar Goyfs for their Jund deck).

this isnt some hype train slow down. this isnt end of modern season, this is because of the new Treasure Chest reward system.

It might be a good idea to buy legacy/modern staples. They will rebound if they fix this shit show, but if they wont ai predict mtgo crashing as we know it.

Its a consumer confidence issue (rather a newfound lack of) not a seasonal issue. People dont trust MTGO or the retention of value in MTGO due to these proze support changes that were just unveiled.

Im pretty confident wizards will learn from this but nor for a while. People dont forget shady things like this very easily.

Though relatively recent, this card does not have a huge supply (31 sellers presently on TCGplayer) due to it being a singleton in a commander product. I would not be surprised to see this card rise to the neighborhood of $10 based on power level/supply/demand in the not too distant future. 

What are your thoughts r/mtgfinance?",1,1
0,It surprises me that there haven't been any reactions to this.

Even the Gatecrash redemption fee change doesn't come close. I personally have too little information to go by to make a justifiable argument.,5,0
1,"It will have a significant impact on foil set redemption. A lot of mythic and rare foils come from set redemption and this is going to cut off that supply leading to higher foil prices. 

In terms of normal standard card set redemption, it doesn't add a significant supply. I wouldn't be surprised if the entire redemption cycle was less than a sealed GP. The 25$, amount of time to get it, and primarily being US focused really limit the amount of redemptions. When it used to be 5$ the value was a lot higher as people would redeem and sell. Given the higher redemption price, it's often just easier to offload your cards for tickets.


Also as of MTGO there used to be this phenomena where a seller or group of sellers hoard one mythic resulting in some ridiculous price which deters people away from redeeming. Don't know if that is still the case though.",4,0
2,"I was thinking about this too, but the answer is probably  ""not at all"", at least long-term. The reason being is that if the EV of sealed product is too high, it will create arbitrage, allowing dealers to be able to make more money opening sealed product and selling singles than selling the sealed product outright. This is essentially what happens now up until the first couple weeks after a set's release, at which point the market is flooded with enough singles to cause demand to drop and the EV of sealed product to equal out or exceed that of the singles on it.  Limiting redemption might mean more paper product is opened, or it takes a little longer to get below the arbitrage point, but I would be surprised if it had any significant impact.",3,0

After getting a job, I found I wanted to buy into standard, and I thought that the redemption methods were a great idea. I'll definitely be getting 4 sets of SOI and EMN. Even for just getting standard playables, its a great deal.

The question I have is, how has expeditions, and how will the masterpiece series effect redemption value? I'm only interested in cards like Kalitas, Gideon, Oath of Nissa, that are actually playable.

Expeditions have little value online, so more of the set value is focused on BFZ/OGW cards, so the ratio of BFZ and OGW from online to paper is much worse than in other sets historically.

The same effect will happen in KLD, with the added new rule of only redemptions when it is the valid draft format.

* SOI brought in a handful of playable zombies and I'm expecting AKH doing the same. Between discard in SOI, revolt in AER and cycling in AKH I think there's a chance of a 6 month window in standard where zombies/graveyard shenanigans could be a thing. 

* Zombie tribal is a perennial favourite in casual, commander and occasionally sees a rogue brew post results in legacy or modern. 

In short, I think there's a slim chance zombies could break through briefly as a real tier deck in standard, and a VERY slim chance zombie players could get some nice surprises in AKH that makes it more viable in eternal formats. Even if that doesn't come to pass I think kitchen table demand might still buoy prices to the extent that I don't take a total bath (though I'd be more likely to tuck them away for a few years and hope for another zombie bonanza set in any case).

In Standard, a deck could easily be build to get the payoff using cycling lands. I see a good control deck becoming available that would want both cycle lands and a strong manland that survives board wipes, like when RTR control decks jammed Mutavault in. $1 is the price for a fringe played Standard cards. Hostile Desert is colorless and could fit in a lot of different decks.
I think the floor is that it sees a little play and I can buylist them at $1.

*  Energy decks are still being played, with BUG and Four Color leading the pack.  The Scarab God is an incredibly potent midrange threat and has spiked as a result.

* Ramunap Red is still playable, as expected.  This format still has a fun police and a ""best"" aggro deck.

* Jim Davis, piloting U/W Approach of the Second Sun is the sole undefeated player at the end of Day 1.  Supply of Approach is drying up on TCGPlayer, with fewer than 90 sellers as I type this.  This card will pop if the deck reaches top 8.  This may be your last chance to pick it up for bulk if you want to play with it.  

* A Tezzeret the Schemer ultimate was used on camera to win a match.  This may drive sales, even though the ultimate only happened because the opposing player was flooding out hard.  ersonally, I still think the card is bad, but it might be time to eat Storm Crow.

* No sightings of Dinosaur or Pirate tribal decks.  Also, the most hyped cards in Ixalan have been relative no-shows.  I didn't see a single Ripjaw Raptor or Growing Rites and only one Carnage Tyrant.  ",24,0

My advice for you, assuming you don't have a ton of interest in following the minutiae of the MTG marketplace, is to sell pretty much everything $10 or more as soon as possible and hold onto bulk rares in case of spikes.  The middleground, $3-$9 cards, might require a bit more finesse, but I'd tend towards moving them, unless you think they could see serious non-rotating play.

1,"Well, for starters I'd pick up a playset each of [[Faerie Miscreant]], [[Spellstutter Sprite]] and [[Pestermite]]. The goal with these last two is to play them on your opponent's turn to put them behind, either by tapping their lands before they draw a card, or countering their spells. [[Faerie Tauntings]] works with this plan, and lets you deal some extra damage, so play 2-3. A couple [[Latchkey Faerie]] and the Miscreants help you keep drawing more faeries, as well as a few [[Peppersmoke]].

[[Quickling]] can help you save your creatures if your opponent is trying to kill them. A lot of them do something when they enter play so Quickling helps you get multiple effects. However, it kinda puts your faerie count behind, so just run like 2 of them. [[Faerie Imposter]] kinda does the same thing, but at 1 mana.

For the spells, try to get your hands on 3-4 each of [[Vapor Snag]], [[Mana Leak]], [[Doomblade]]. Finally, run about 20-ish lands, between 4 [[Dimir Guildgate]], a bunch of Islands, some Swamps, maybe an [[Evolving Wilds]] or three. Your friends can help you flesh out the rest of it.

Dominaria will have a significant Legendary theme. 
We already know that Karn, Teferi and Jhoria are in the set. 
Thanks to PAX, we also have the art reveal that showed us Jaya and Linessa.  Linessa especially could hint that we'll see some of the other ""Granduer"" legends in new forms as well. 
Knowing nothing else about the set, we have 5 legends, with the potential of another 4 more. 

Plus, we potentially have art of Venser's Skyship, and the most recent art leak was along with the phrase ""Gather Legends"". 

Going further, if I had to guess on the set's planeswalkers, it will be Karn, Ajani (Remember, he went to Dominaria instead of being an idiot) and Jaya, with Jaya and Karn getting Planeswalker deck versions. (Red and Colorless- while the decks have been 2 color, the walkers have been 1.)

And now for the big crazy one:
Dominaria will have legendary dual lands with some other wrinkle that makes them not violate ""the spirit of the reserved list"".  
This gives them an excuse to not reprint fetchlands in Standard for the next two years, throws EDH players a major bone, and really won't hurt standard in any way. Modern does get another fetchable set of duals and does take away some slots for shocklands, but should actually play well alongside them- most decks only run 2-3 shocks anyways, they'd probably move to 1 shock, 1 legendary, and then either 1 more shock or off-color legendary. 

Plus, it gives some access to legacy. People that have duals would maybe play 1 alongside their normal duals, but it gives some access to players with NO duals.
If this happened, Dominaria would break all sales records... and it actually would probably increase the price of Duals.",29,0

3,"My responses:  

1. That's putting a big step of faith on Wizards. 2017 was a year where there were quite a few misses in terms of supplementary products (The Starter Set comes to mind-just watch the Professor's video to see why it's bad). I prefer to just stick to buying singles, being a veteran Standard player myself.  
2. Agree with you on the sealed booster boxes-there's still a huge glut to get over since Unstable and the holiday doldrums took a lot of wind out of their sails. Some Iconic masters rares have a chance to recover even sooner since Pro Tour Rivals of Ixalan is a Modern format rather than the usual standard format.  
3. Dominaria absolutely has potential, just because there is a chance of getting some rather new types of dual lands. My prediction is that these lands are the cards to at least have before 2018 rotation.  
4. Rivals of Ixalan will at least be better than Ixalan, limited wise. The limited format is godawful due to the overemphasis of tribal synergies, and the lack of support of Black-Green and Blue-White. Usually in a GOOD large set draft there is a gold uncommon cycle that feature all TEN of the two color combinations. The fact that they left out two was a huge warning flag for the limited format. There has never been too much of a big hype for the core sets, but I think that M18 is going to have a few surprises there. Origins had quite a few surprises to send off the core set (I fondly remember the flip walkers, even though I NEVER pulled one out of the twenty drafts that I did back in 2015.  
5. It would be absolutely foolish for wizards to do another masters set this year when we already have M25 announced. Just look at how badly Ixalan, Iconic, and Unstable got split in player interest upon their releases.   
5b. Not sure they do a Pauper Masters... I think Eternal Masters 2 is more likely than a Pauper Masters and would come first before they think of that (Hey, they have to leave a set of Rishadan Port right?)
6. That's really going to be pushing things. I think there is a higher than negligible chance that Rishadan Port gets put in that set though.  
7. Agreed. I personally am going to wait 2 weeks after the print run before pulling the trigger.  
8. Definitely more reserve list shenanigans will come up in 2018. It doesn't help that financiers like Rudy will only make the Reserve list platform even more unstable. I think we may see more Vintage tournaments allowing a wider number of proxies as a result of this.  
9. MTGO is a sinking ship. Absolutely nothing should be touched in that platform with a ten foot pole. That's even if MTG arena doesn't catch fire (It has some potential though).
10. Yeah, the card quality problem should be a top priority for Wizards. It's been talked to death by Wedge, The Professor, and many other well known keepers of the community.  

My own personal prediction:  
I think there will be unbannings for Modern to shake up the Pro Tour. I am keeping a close eye on BBE (and I know a lot of other people are) and Stoneforge Mystic (a long shot, but actually possible from what I have heard). Standard will face maybe one banning to rein in Energy decks.

Rivals will be average, Merfolk will become playable, Dinasaurs may too, energy will likely still be the best deck by a perfect margin of obnoxious but not ban worthy. 

Masters 25 will be okay. Filter lands and Doubling Season will be there, along with Senguir Vampire and Serra Angel (probably uncommon?). I think the set will do fine. No messing with the reserve list.

Dominaria will have a Karn planeswalker (maybe an OG reprint) and Counterspell reprinted. The set will be a big hit as it pulls people into the lore of Magic, and will help the health of Standard. The set will be maybe even as good as OG Innistrad in drafting, relevance for Eternal formats, flavor, and Standard.

I agree that Paper Pauper is finally going to take off. The format will grow in size, price, and will probably get more attention from casuals and pros alike.

11,">) Paper pauper will start to take off. I would even be very happy with a Pauper Master's set. If this is the second masters set, it will be a huge hit.

Wizards will never give any support to pauper. The least of which is the design space of commons and uncommons would have to be considered if they want to support it with product releases. What would a ""Pauper Masters"" set look like when there are no rares or uncommons in the booster packs? Would certain format playable commons become the ""rares"" of the set and only appear as often as a normal rare would? 

The most of which is the format is the anti-thesis of what they want to accomplish - Sell as much of their sealed product as they can. You can buy x4 common/uncommon sets of new releases on Ebay for like 40 bucks. Wizards does not want widespread adoption of a format that requires so little to purchase.

3. Silver boarder sells. Unstable seen as a success and lands are a good hold long term. Probably won’t be another full unset for a few years but wouldn’t be surprised to see silver boarder December make an appearance again in 2018 and some small supplemental (possibly holiday reprints) silver product next year. 

4. Arena will be huge success. Long term, paper Mtg format will be created to match “Arena” format will be non rotating probably kaladesh on. They might possibly start later but Maro has expressed interest in an eternal format without fetch lands. Treat rotation accordingly. 

5. 2000$ timetwister. Commander legality is so much more important than vintage. Move sooner rather than later. It’ll be a target this tax return season. There will always be rich kids wanting to stomp their friends. 

6. No movement on reserve list from Wotc. Long term (2-3 years) Disney will buy hasbro. They are not going to say no to printing liquid gold and will slowly abolish and reprint the reserve list. Better lawyers than hasbro, more willingness to fight it. The actual motivation  for the sale will be toy production, specifically Star Wars toys, but long term Disney will do well with Wotc brands and magic will enter a new renaissance.

1) Rivals will be an average set that will impact standard. However standard will continue to lose popularity in the paper world.

2) Arena will release and people will play standard mostly there. Magic will grow in popularity and some users of arena will transition to paper.

3) Standard will still die off in most stores and become like the old block constructed. A test for the pros for a couple of weeks for big events like the pro tour but regular people won't touch it as much.

4) Wizards will create a new format somewhere between standard and modern. 

5) Dominaria will be popular but won't fix standard in the paper world. People will play it a lot in arena.

6) The masters set will be better than iconic masters but not as popular as a modern masters.

7) Wizards will bow to pressure and do a pauper GP. They simply need more competitive formats. and they will do a gp in each continent similar to how they do legacy now.

8) Game codes in physical packs will become a thing and more products will get more premium features. (foil tokens, masterpiece cards etc.)

9) Local stores will start getting more business later in the year as people transition from arena. I still think it depends on their ability to make a format similar to extended or frontier that is cheap and has a wide range of strategies.

3) Dominaria - I really hope Richard Garfield can work his Magic. I am not sure why, but I expect some high calibre (gameplay-wise) reprints here. Maybe Counterspell, maybe Armageddon or Winter Orb? I hope they simply let fly!

4) Core Set 2018 will be okeyish, because nobody expects anything of it.

5) The RL will spike even more and there might be a discussion from WotC what to do about it. Maybe they understand that they can sell us just half of legacy with their eternal masters-line and starve us of Duals. Maybe they finally repeal it or find a work around.",1,0
17,"1) challenger decks will be good. Not great but certainly better than the dd series.
2) people only liked mm2017 because of the fetches. Literally, 5 fetch lands, blood moon, damnation, cavern, snap, goyf Lilly. That's it. Completely blinded by the fetches. The limited sucked, and the box variance was the largest we've seen yet. I agree that Iconic masters will recover. 
3) Dominaria will be great. Masterpieces will be amazeballs.
4)Rivals will help ixalan limited but, just like it's predecessor, it won't do dick all for standard. Core set will be a great limited set and will reinvigorate standard with new blood (once KLD rotates)
5) pauper has already started taking off. It's great. 1000x better than frontier but a pauper masters is unlikely unless it's like 3 card packs or something.
6) been saying this since hascon on this sub, masters25 will be a return to form. More mm2013 meets eternal masters than iconic meets mm2015. It's going to have some surprises, maybe highest ev since 2013.
7) agree except island will be $2+. Foils will drop to $25 for mtn and plains, $35 for swamp and forest, and $50 for island.
8) just like rudemort predicted today, the RL cards will continue to sky rocket. This may prompt something from wizards (maybe something crazy, like expanding the RL or changing the ""foil/promo rule"" haha)
9) arena won't be very successful unless they make card collections and trading similar to mtgo. They also need to address people who play mtgo and how they are going to pull them in

21,"On Arena, I think it will disappoint people.

If it's a good way to play Magic and cheap, it starts competing not just with Hearthstone (which WotC want), but also with paper Magic.

If there is any appreciable churn from paper to Arena (low double digit percentage of the playerbase), a lot of paper stores will collapse. This is great news for dealer chains with enough capital to profit from the misfortune of small store owners, but it's terrible for the playerbase (short term) and Wizards (medium term), to say nothing about the dealers themselves.

________

If Wizards are smart, they will make Arena less of a solid value proposition so as to keep paper-to-Arena churn in the single figures (percentage of players).

And Wizards are smart.

Wizards will want Arena to mostly be a player acquisition tool for paper, not a substitute for it. Like Duels was (the most successful acquisition tool paper ever had).

22,"I'll throw one out there.

I will be able to purchase a box of Iconic Masters for less $ than I can purchase a box of Unstable.  I expect this might be true at the end of 2018.   Not sure what prices will be like after that.

1)  I expect the Unstable reprint to not effect the booster box prices too much.  I think they're going to reprint with the goal of satisfying drafting demand for the next few months.  After that, WOTC focus will be on promoting and selling Masters 25 (March), Dominaria (April), Core Set 2019 (July).  The increase in product will lower the prices of things like the lands and tokens though.

2)  The people buying Unstable boxes are the casual players who care less about the value of individual singles.  The value is in the sealed product that can be used for draft.  It's one of the reasons why the shops around me aren't cracking boxes to resell singles.  Normally I feel like a booster box price and it's EV of singles are closely correlated.  With Unstable, I don't think this applies

3) Iconic Masters is a fine set to draft.  However, I found that nothing really stands out about the format to make it unique (whereas Unstable does).  Iconic Masters box price will be closely tied to the EV of it's singles.  With frequent reprints,  I think it'll take a much longer time before the sealed booster box price will go up.

So it wouldn't surprise me that at the end of 2018, the cheapest I can get an sealed box of Unstable for is $140.  And i'll still be able to pick up Iconic Masters boxes for less than $140",1,0

lol

Arena is just the next Magic Duels with a Hearthstone interface. It hasn't shown that it can handle large stacks and intricate interactions that MTGO regularly does, and from videos I've seen of it, it didn't even include basic things like turn stops, priority passing on draw and end steps along with other basics MTG gameplay. It looks like a fucking joke, and I haven't even touched on 8-card packs. (LOL) Also if p2p trading isn't going to be allowed then good luck getting people to take it seriously as a way to play constructed formats.

26,"**2018 will be WoTC trying to kill, or at least hurt for good, the secondary market**, and there is no other way for them than to kill the RL !

1/ MM25 will began to touch at the RL with some old staples that made magic history, it wouldn't be THE anniversary edition if it does not contains any of the cards that made MTG, the print run will be low as it will be the test to see how the market and people react and to incite sellers to sell at MSRP.

2/ Challenger Decks will be very good with some unexpected reprints for modern and a very large distribution (and I mean very large) to incite new players to enter the format and allow players to buy at MSRP (for this they need to distribute them at Walmarts, as WPN stores only would create a speculation that would kill the intent).

3/ Then Dominaria will be a very big hit, and will bring back old players with again some new RL reprints (I would bet on dual lands).

4/ Core set 2019  will be the final touch with again some new RL reprints, it will be the equivalent of Revised, with some of the best staples that have been printed since.

5/ Depending on the success and market reaction ABU could stay reserved for a while, or not...

27,"Gimme your predictions for 2018 just for bragging rights, if you are willing. Future predictions are the most important. Here are my BOLD predictions

1) Challenger decks are going to be a hit. They are going to be very good and Wotc will not screw it up. Standard (we can argue but I am pretty sure at least looking at my own LGS that it is on the decline). Standard needs a boost, and this is Wotc's solution. Will it work? Yes and No. Booster box sales of standard sets will plummet (except Dominaria), but challenger decks will sell well. They will be worth buying if you are interested in standard.

2) Iconic Masters will recover at the end of 2018. It will take that long to get back to 160. It is actually a good set. The value is in the rares and not the mythics. Players have not adjusted. People complained that M2015 value was all in the mythics, so this time they put it in the rares and people balked. For heaven's sake the dragons are rare and not mythic. We were spoiled with M2017, Iconic Masters was not that bad, so it will recover.

3) Dominaria will be remembered and will sell well just for nostalgia sake.

4) M2018, Rivals of Ixalan will be further failures. They will be printed to oblivion, and distributors will be stuck with them. Look for bargains here.

5) If Wotc does a second masters set, it will also be a disaster.

5) Paper pauper will start to take off. I would even be very happy with a Pauper Master's set. If this is the second masters set, it will be a huge hit.

6) the 25th anniversary will be a hit and they might surprise us with reserve list collection edition cards like power nine/ cradle, tabernacle??? - conspiracy theory here. I told you my predictions would be bold

7) Unstable lands will drop to 1-1.25 after the second print run and that is when you buy.

8) old school vintage cards will continue to go up as confidence erodes with massive print runs and fakes.

9) MTG arena will be successful. MTGO - yikes

10) Wotc will fix the card quality problem.

- Check the feedback of the seller

5,"Yesterday someone pointed out that this card combos with a new card from Dominaria (Helm of the Host) and it got me thinking that this card has a little room to grow for a few reasons.

1. Although the combo probably isn't standard breaking or even all that good, players will want to try it and I wouldn't be surprised if it's popular amongst casuals
2. If you are playing it in the combo, you will need 4 copies of it. Being a Mythic, this demand has potential to drive price a little bit.
3. It's played in over 1700 decks on EDH rec including some really popular decks. This is a card that EDH players open and don't immediately get rid of. 
4. If brawl takes off, I could see this as a staple. 1700 decks isn't too shabby in a powerful format of EDH. In an underpowered format like Brawl, it could see it being one of the stronger cards available. When brawl was first announced, this was one of the cards that immediately jumped to my mind as a card that would be perfect for that type of format. 

I would probably try to trade for this card, but I probably won't be spending $2 on it. I'd feel better trading away cards that have peaked for it rather than buying them up. 

**The real take away is this:** If you have them sitting in a bulk box or if you were about to buylist this card, it might be time to sit on it a little longer and revisit this card after Dominaria comes out. May make you some extra cash if you have a lot of these around.

If you really want to buy from MCM, the best way to go would be bank transfer or coupons because of fees ( Be aware that even with bank transfer your bank may charge you a fee on an international tranfer) . Paypal fees are just ridiculous: 0.35€ + 5&#37; of the total buy. Does any of your relatives have a MCM account? because if they do, they can give you coupons for you to redeem in your account, kinda like a gift card. Or if you know anyone that you trust with an MCM account, you can ask them to print the coupons for you.

As other people have said, Italy's Post is just an embarrassment, I don't buy or sell to Italy ( you can filter this on MCM ) because it takes way too long and the amount of lost packages, to and from outside of Italy, is just unbelievable. So try to buy from Italian sellers, particularly Italian professional sellers and use registered mail, which will be more expensive, but if the cards don't arrive MCM will hold the money until the situation is resolved and MCM will 99&#37; side with the buyer on registered mail.

With all of this said, you would be better off to go an LGS, I think its too much trouble to go through just to buy cards for a tiny discount ( with all the fees and all ).

Cards that are usually cheaper here: any Japanese language, expeditions and alikes,  any new released set that professional sellers want to unload fast, judge promos. Look at the ""shopping wizard"" feature of MCM which allows you to create a wants list and then searches for the seller with the most number of cards in your list for the least price possible ( which is good to save on post fees ).

1,"For at-a-glance prices, TCGPlayer's market value is the best IMO because it reflects what people are actually paying.  

Average is a terrible price indication IMO because it doesn't respect sales. It takes into account listings and is easily skewed by high priced listings. This is why it's usually higher than market value. It also isn't good enough to just both be using average and call it even because averages on each card aren't equally off. They're each influenced by the listings of that particular card.  

The *absolute* best price to use for a card's worth is to check yourself and see what the lowest price you could buy it at if you wanted it ""right now"" from a reputable seller. In the US, that usually means that you'd check TCGPlayer and Ebay, sort by lowest buy now and see what the price is for the lowest authentic copy from a high feedback seller is with shipping taken into account. An example of where this is better is something like Valakut recently. The market value remained around $15-$18 while there were no copies available anywhere for that price. Cheapest you could get it was $25. You might say ""well, Valakut is on it's way back down.. it wasn't worth $25"". Do not rely 100% on a third party to tell you what a card is worth. You've got to make *some* of the decision yourself. If you think Valakut isn't a $25 card, make a case to your trade partner and see if they agree in the form of being willing to lower it. If they don't agree, don't trade and see who was right in a couple of months.

3,Lowest price of the cards condition is what I use,4,0
4,"I think Average (Listed Median) is a better representation of what a card is really worth for several reasons:

1) We know how they got to the number.  Its the Median Average of all the copies listed for sale.  Very clean and very simple.  Market Price is a formula they've refused to fully divulge.  All they'll say is that its ""compiled from recent, completed sales that occurred on TCGplayer.com"".  
MTGGoldfish was going to switch to Market price a while back to make things more player friendly since most people see Market price as ""the price people expect to pay for the card when buying it.""  They switched over for about a half a day and all the Price Lists, Movers & Shakers, Price Histories, etc got messed up.  When they wrote to TCG about it trying to figure out where things went wrong and fix the error on Goldfish's end, TCG refused to tell them how they formulated Market price (even though Goldfish links people to TCG for sales) and they had to switch back to Average (Listed Median).

2) Market Price very poorly reflects accurate pricing on cards that have recently been bought out or are in the process of spiking.  [Look at ""Stoneforge Mystic"" (the original Worldwake printing) right now.](https://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/worldwake/stoneforge-mystic?partner=MTGGLDFSH)  As of me writing this, its Market Price is $32.29 and its Listed Median is $51.95.  But if you look at the site, the cheapest copy you can get right now is $37.85 for a Damaged copy ($39.29 for the next cheapest that isn't Damaged).  That's a $5 (or ~17%) price difference.  Putting aside the arguments about potential unbannings and overhyping etc, that's a pretty significant price difference.  

3) Average takes availability into account when reflecting the value of a card.  While a card maybe have ""Market Value"" of $50, if there's only 4 copies left listed on TCG, the Average will more than likely reflect that and allow for supply & demand to have a say in value.",2,0

I avoid “buy” prices or latest ebay sales because those snipped prices are not the norm. Median or Market are both good because it’s truly the average or close to what people are selling for.  A better average would be to probably find a price somewhere in the middle of median and market. It’s all dependent on how many Damaged/MP/LP  vs NM cards are being sold to affect market or how many are listed at a specific condition to affect median.  Just remember, your trading. Use trade value not the cheapest single listing you can find on a card.

Think about that Experiment One comparison a bit more though. You want to play E1 early. You *have* to so you can grow it using the rest of the creatures in your hand. If you top deck E1, it's a 1/1 and won't likely grow much because you already used your creature resources in your hand. Pelt Collector is similar early and better late because of the dies trigger. Your opponent is motivated to kill your larger creatures and that will grow Pelt Collector, whereas Experiment One would have remained a 1/1. 

It's Standard playable and can be slotted into Modern Bushwhacker Zoo and other aggressive Zoo variants.

Those are the ones that gain value over time. Those are you Search for Azcantas. Not cards to pimp out standard decks... I made that mistake in Ixalan buying a bunch of foil dinosaurs. FML; never again. 
I'll give two examples:

1) FOIL Mission Briefing
The number one reason is I see this card being a modern control staple is because of Miracles, namely in U/W Control. 

2) FOIL Pelt Collector
This card is a freaking beatstick and MagicAids already found a cool looking Zoo deck in Modern for it. I think it will be a staple in those kinds of builds, no matter what format you see it in.

I can go more in depth about these but those are the main reasons. You guys have any of your personal contenders? ",0,1

If RNA provides enough modern useable cards for both simic and orzhov, things will get a lot more interesting for the other two fastlands.

So with karn it is an instant lockpiece once they both hit the battlefield, locking every opponent out of their mana and any abilities they may have.

Is this a good hold for the long run?  I know that there is no definite answer on the print run of this set (seems to be of great debate).

&#x200B;

so I've been drafting lately and don't feel like keeping all the cards, besides they are all standard, it's unlikely on average they'll have better pricing than now. I was wondering how do you sell the lots? Are there best practices? Like: 

* What % discount of the current market price of the valuable cards should one offer? 
* Should one list all the cards in the lot or only the rares/mythics and playables? Or none at all?
* Is there some magic ratio of good card/bulk cards to make a lot interesting?  For instance, the one I'm putting up is 5 mythics (2 see play in constructed), 25 rares (\~12 see play in constructed), 100 NC (didn't track count this part, say at least 20 or played in constructed), 370 C.  Which is roughly 30 boosters and good picking:P

5,"Hi folks, just getting into speccing, thought it'd be interesting to discuss the possible effects of this weekend's big story. With Magic going big as Esports (or wanting to), how will this influence the cardboard?  


For instance, do we expect an influx of new tabletop players? Is it a coincidence that 2 of the 4 Challenger Decks are near exact copies of 2 of the 3 most dominant Bo1/Invitiational decks, WW and Mono-Red (and that the one that's not represented is both the most expensive to assemble and the trickiest to navigate)? I know WotC supposedly decided on the decklists a long time ago - but I'm sure they'd have a good idea of which decks would be strongest in the Duo Standard format they were planning.  
I also noticed Hydroid Krasis dropped from €22,- to €13,- over the past month (yes, EU here). Could this have to do with Sultai's bad positioning in Bo1? Is it a far fetch to think Arena-results would influence people's tabletop choices? Or to think Duo Standard could pop up as a sanctioned tabletop format in the future?

If people who play Arena also get into paper in any form, then they will have to adapt to a different experience. Like someone else said, the LGS experience varies widely. I have had great experiences, and I have also played a small sample of cheaters and douche-bags. The LGS business model does not seem to be working too well. Some people have great LGSs (I do, even with the small number of bad experiences), and then others don't.

The biggest beneficiary of anything happening to Magic seems to be Commander. Who knew that the format junk rares went to get played would be such a huge success? I think Arena conversion to paper will likely most be in Commander. And here is where I think the expectation of higher card prices and many more EDH spikes will likely not turn out.

That being said there are several current Modern format staples and cycles of cards that are still overpriced barriers to entry to the format, so it’s possible the new juiced Commander decks in August, or possible Modern Event decks could help bring the secondary market prices down if some of those cards show up in those products.",2,0

As mentioned this year’s commander set is supposed to be pretty good, of course they said last year would be too to justify the price hike but now they’ve put themselves in the position of having to follow through on that since people are still upset at the lack of chase re-prints or really all that good new cards.

I think also you mistake reserve list cards being played as them being ‘staples’. On the cEDH side they’re more common as some deck strategies even essentially require them (looking at you [[Hermit Druid]]) but even there they aren’t staples with really only non-budget decks and primers listing them unless someone happens to own one anyways. And since the format is non-competitive people are typically very ok with a nicer proxy (though it’s not like new players coming off Arena are going to jump right into paying a couple hundred bucks for luxury designer cardboard anyways lol)

18,"I've been thinking about what will happen when eventually a portion of the new players that Arena is bringing in get into paper magic and which constructed formats will see the most financial opportunity.

Arena is great of course, easy drafts and affordable standard decks. Solving some of the problems that people who don't have an LGS might have. But the main thing Arena lacks is the ability to play with friends at the kitchen table. Playing either competitive or more casual. No matter which, the experience is undeniably better in person.

Some competitive players will eventually switch to modern, because of it's more stable meta and the ability to play your favorite decks with longer lasting success. A surge of new players will inevitably inflate the price of modern singles and with modern now being the figurehead of paper magic (now that Arena has claimed Standard) I predict that WoTC will be reprinting most of the modern staples to keep the format accessible. You can already see this in the M20 leyline reprints ( \[\[Leyline of the Void|M20\]\] \[\[Leyline of Sanctity|M20\]\]), Ravnica block shockland reprints (\[\[Steam Vents|GRN\]\]) and I predict many more to come in the future. It's for this reason I am a little hesitant to put my money into Modern staples (I did buy a playset all of the Horizon lands (\[\[Fiery Islet|MH1\]\]), curious to see how this will work out).

The other format Arena does't feature is Comander/EDH. And this is where my interest currently lies!  
I believe this format has stayed under the radar a bit. Not a great amount of reprints, at least not in standard sets. UMA was of course Reprint City with things like \[\[Demonic Tutor|UMA\]\], \[\[Back to Basics|UMA\]\], \[\[Temporal Manipulation|UMA\]\], \[\[Phyrexian Altar|UMA\]\], \[\[Phyrexian Tower|UMA\]\], \[\[Ancient Tomb|UMA\]\], \[\[Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth|UMA\]\] and some more. But UMA was a premium set, so reprint's did not hugely impact single prices. The format is still being supported and marketed by WoTC with some cool new commanders being printed every new set and a commander product coming later this year (word on the street is that it's gonna be good). The format also features many great reserved list staples with things like original dual lands (\[\[Volcanic Island|3ED\]\]), Urza's Saga Lands (\[\[Gaea's Cradle|USG\]\]) and many more very playable reserved list cards. Because there's so many reserved list staples I find it unlikely that WoTC will reprint the entire format to keep it accessible. There are just too many cards to be able to do this and this would just create enormous price gaps between the format's reserved and non-reserved staples (which is already the case) and not solve much at all.

WoTC seems to be focusing on keeping modern accessible and Commander has been avoiding the reprints. What do you guys think? Will this hold up? I'm very interested in your opinion!

Time walk is awesome, great art, cool effect, and thats a good price, but Ancestral is just so much better.

I am seeing it as pretty strong. It's not that hard to play at 4 mana and has immediate benefit as soon as it hits the battlefield with a cavalcade or two out. Even without cavalcade out, it's devastating. As soon as I play it, a large majority of opponents concede immediately.

With a 1/1 trash army, as soon as he drops, they are all suddenly 3/3's.

Cavalcade triggers are all now 3 damage instead of 1. All on-death triggers (footlight fiend, ember hauler, those little devils Tibalt makes) are suddenly 3-4 damage each. Scorch Spitters are suddenly firing off 3 damage fireballs. Spitfires now hit for +2 on top of all their pumps from the cavalcade/ScorchSpitters. Shocks are suddenly 4 damage. Heartfire is now 6 damage.

I run 2 of those in my deck, and it's a pretty consistent win con. I am considering moving to 3 copies for even more consistency. 

&#x200B;

I collect paper MTG more than I play it. I rarely play in store, mostly with friends, so I can't attest to what I see in play out in the wild. I only know what I see playing in Arena. Of course since the set isn't out yet, it's really hard to tell what you will see for a while in person.

The current Cavalcade build is really cheap, financially speaking. Adding Torbran changes the deck entirely into a powerful heavy hitter IMO.

Hopefully some actual play experience with this may help in decision making, who knows if the play base will actually buy into it or not.

I would like to buy a playset of these for my own collection before prices go up. I really love this card.

Really amped up my bolts, skreds, abrade, anger of the gods, rabblemaster tokens, chandra, koth and dragons. 

People miss that its actually a 4/4 for 4 that gives all your creatures +2/+0 and damn near doubles the impact of all your damage and burn spells. I feel like its going to be a staple in all standard red decks going forwards.

  I'm watching Rudy's CB videos and counting cards being opened in the last and 2nd last card slot for value here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/dbnrgl/eld\_collector\_booster\_box\_current\_value\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/dbnrgl/eld_collector_booster_box_current_value_and/)

From box opening videos, it seems that every 4th pack has a foil full art in it. That means that it's roughly 80€ for a random foil extended art card, by MKM prices.
I see the floor for these as being 15-20€ for even the bulk foils, with ceilings of 200€ for the best Modern staples and the like, to compensate.

5,"It's all Pauper-based demand as it got heavily featured in [this article](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-throne-of-eldraine-pauper-set-review/):

>Without a doubt, Mystic Sanctuary will be the highest-impact card in the set (assuming the bannings don’t change things too much–which is possible). Blue Flicker decks have already established themselves as the top strategy and this is a card that directly ports, in a powerful way, into those decks.

>Jeskai seems able to easily use Mystic Sanctuary because it already plays a mostly Snow Island mana base. Tron will include a singleton copy of the land to find with Expedition Map. I have a strong feeling that Bant Flicker just got the tool it needed to become a Tier 1 strategy. So, basically this is a card that all the Flicker decks wanted and can use to great effect. Let’s discuss the applications for each deck real quick.

>Tron: Tron already plays Mortuary Mire to not deck itself, and this is a strictly better Mortuary. It makes blue, rather than black. By the time you are worried about decking, it should be easy to have three other Islands in play to set up the Ghostly Flicker Loop. In Tron, Mystic Sanctuary is an upgrade.

>Jeskai: It’s the biggest freeroll in Jeskai because the mana base already has a ton of islands. In a sense, it will allow Jeskai a few things: First, redundancy of the Ephemerate combo. If the opponent can break up the loop, for instance by fizzling an Ephemerate, Jeskai can buy it back and start over. Secondly, it allows Jeskai to play its sideboard cards repeatedly once they’ve been drawn.

>Bant: The Bant Familiars deck was already extremely good and it is actually able to take the best advantage of Mystic Sanctuary. It has an Island-heavy mana base already and the Familiars team up to make Ghostly Flicker + Mystic Sanctuary + Mulldrifter a deadly engine and capable of looping without a Wall or Archaeomancer.

>It’s also worth noting that bouncelands can pick up and redeploy Mystic Sanctuary to generate additional triggers as the game goes on.

>When I was brewing Fastbond combo decks, I understood there were basically no land options that do what Mystic Sanctuary does, so on uniqueness alone the card is significant. The one thing that annoys me about the card in Pauper is that we don’t have instant-speed interaction for lands to fizzle a Ghostly Flicker–nothing but a counter breaks it up. The Flicker decks are already trying to ignore everything the opponent does, so I guess it’s only fitting they get a combo that is even more difficult for non-blue decks to interact with. Answers are not nearly as cheap as the proactive cards.

>There’s little doubt in my mind that Sanctuary is straight-up broken card that will make its impact felt not just in Pauper, but in every format ranging from Legacy (Miracles), Commander, Modern (Cryptic Command) to Standard.

While I don't agree with the last sentence and think this card will only get played in fringe decks in Modern (Mono U Turns comes to mind), I can see the appeal in Pauper.",2,0

1,"**For the style of cards:** My expectation is that shops will not adjust their buylists for the fact that there are 4 versions of a card rather than 2. The market will be split between functional plays - those who buy played cards to get the cheapest possible and collectors who just want bling. The collectors won't care about the base version of cards. Whether they prefer regular foil or extended art/alternate border non-foil is to debate but evidently the most sought after card will be the extended art/alternate border foil (the most premium bling). 

&#x200B;

My guess is that even the best chase rare will not be that expensive due to the multiple versions showing up. My other guess is regular foils will also command a much lower premium than people are used to. The increased foil pull rate and the fancy card frames will crowd out the regular cards. I would sell every version other than the foil full-arts, and especially look to sell the in-between versions (non-foil extended art and regular foils)

&#x200B;

**For the specific cards that are overhyped:** It depends on the next standard Tier 1 meta. I don't think many cards will make a splash into eternal formats whilst they are still in standard. Even good EDH cards like the Great henge can't spike because the set is still in print. So you can probably read up on the best standard decks, make your bets and sell the cards that don't appear in the likely lists. 

&#x200B;

In regards to how GP mtl went in previous years, I've been in last couple of years and usually the prices are insanely inflated for hyped-up cards. Lots of packs are opened, players use their tickets for standard packs and hope to trade-in ASAP. Sellers usually know that low-end rares are free flowing - they chase after those rare pulls that people are hyped for like a foil alternate border murderous rider or foil full art Oko.",1,0

1,"current take: This is going to have a big impact on the Pioneer meta, and Pioneer is the number one source of MtG market volatility recently.  There's a lot of parallels between this and Cat Combo, but this is better for several reasons:

1. As an indestructible Enchantment, Heliod is way harder to remove than Saheeli

2. Unlike Cat Combo, which needed WUR to work, this only requires one white mana source over two turns, this is way more splashable

3. Ballista by itself is just a good card, and Heliod may be solid in the correct shell.  Either way, unlike Cat Combo decks that threw away 7-8 slots on two cards that weren't very good outside of being an ""I Win"" button, at worst a deck is only using up 3-4 slots on Heliod for their ""I Win"" button, an potentially there's no significant loss to running both of these cards.

4. Cat Combo needs to swing out and is weak to instant speed removal.  As long as there's mana available this wins through removal.

Anyway, this is better Cat Combo that fits into more lists.  Pioneer already took Walking Ballista from a 12-15 dollar card to a 17-20 dollar card.  This could very easily send the price even further up.

The problem is the power.  I am fully convinced Heliod or Ballista will eat a ban because of this.  Can't really begin to guess which, but if this puts up Pioneer results (and I'm 100% convinced it will) then I'd call Ballista a risky keep.

EDIT:  Nuclear Take incoming:  If this combo takes off, there will probably be a big emphasis on preventing lifegain.  Invest in Atarka's Command, Skullcrack, Rampaging Ferocidon.",20,0
2,This card is more broken in pioneer and modern than combo's that are already banned. How is this not going to get banned?,14,0
3,"I said most of this in a thread for cube, but I'm curious what the folks over here think.

It seems that the combo between this card and walking ballista is likely not a concern in modern, where a t4 combo is par for the course, but it is notable that oko can't hit heliod unless he's a creature, which is unlikely if you're just going for the combo. I think the combo is just a bit too slow for modern, or at the very least it doesn't currently look better than druid combo. I don't see many ways to do the combo before turn 4, and I'm not confident it's always going to happen on turn 4. You do have a few turns to set up mana or scales, but it seems a smidge vulnerable. 

Pioneer looks doable though.

given that the goal is to get out a ballista with 2 counters and have the 2 mana to activate heliod on the same turn, it seems likely to me that this combo would want to be in a hardened scales list, since with scales out, this is doable by t4. Heliod obviously doesn't slot into the GB hardened scales lists as they currently exist, so either the list goes abzan to keep [[winding constrictor]], or people simply shift to Selesnya Scales. Either way, the manabase takes a hit. GB has great lands to use but tacking on white does reduce the consistency a tad, and the ally dual lands are just worse. Granted, the W and B are mostly just splashes for one key card each, constrictor and this new heliod. An effective deck that can take advantage of the combo might not take long to get started, and the scales decks are already really good.

I'm not too worried if it stays around 15-20 dollars, and it doesn't look like this card is a huge concern exceptfor pioneer, though I think it likely sees standard play. Thoughts? Pick up ASAP? Wait and see?",7,0

My opinion is that there isn't much demand for full sets, but there is a little.  If you're already close, and if there is value to you in having the complete set, then it might be worth it.  You won't make money on it over just collecting singles, but if you enjoy completing and/or having the full set for some time, that might be worthwhile as a way to get some enjoyment without really losing much or anything for it.  The real worthless stuff is the bulk unplayables so I would recommend staying away from buying too many of those as singles.

Leyline is a card you play when you want to just nuke a graveyard strategy, like Dredge or Reanimator.  I don't think Standard is going to be so rife with graveyard-based action that you'll need to go to Leyline to fight it all.  I think something like Return to Nature is a way better card for what you want to be able to do in Standard.  Being able to single out the Elspeth from the graveyard while also having a card that can fight over things like Fires of Invention is more what I'd be interested in.  That card in particular is poised to get a lot better actually, now that I think about it.  Depending on how things shake out, it could even carve out a role as a green Doom Blade if there are any widely-played enchantment creatures.

4,"Disclaimer: I'm a Canadian so my views on these topics are based on the Canadian market and retailers but should still apply to the US market (hopefully).

Hello, over the past couple of months after building numerous EDH decks, I noticed that the various online retailers here were selling singles at sometimes wildly different prices. I found it easy to use 3-4 online retailers, find the cards I wanted at the lowest price among them, and then use their free or very low cost shipping option to net huge savings on cards. These ""savings"" were perceived as a comparison of the spot singles prices to a US benchmark such as TCG, or other US retailer prices.

Why is this important? 
Well, this is mtgfinance. Ideally, we should not only speculate on future gains on cards but also try to find a current price that is acceptable to purchase the single at. Unlike stocks, we can't simply assess balance sheets or discount future cash flows to determine an asset's intrinsic value or price. So I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, we have to rely heavily on retailers to set prices based solely on demand and supply of the singles. Not surprisingly, this gives retailers a lot of power to determine singles prices and takes away from from the idea of an efficient market that would ideally be present for our secondary market here. 

The upside?
It seems that because of this, at least in Canada, this results in quite a bit variance between singles prices. If a decent benchmark can be found that somewhat accurately reflects the instrinsic value of the single based on supply and demand, then you could use that benchmark to take advantage of price arbitrage when you are looking to buy singles. For those that do not know, the gist of arbitrage theory is that in an efficient market, buyers and sellers would take advantage of price differences and thus, by increasing or decreasing demand of specific assets, bring asset prices to their intrinsic value across markets. This definitely does not seem the case for the mtg market, at least in Canada, and gives us the opportunity to search for the lowest price for each single.

What to do with this information?
Considering these points, I would urge those of you who are not loyal to a specific retailer, or have a local game store to support, to shop around for your singles as you are likely to find the lowest prices for your singles by spreading your total purchase across numerous retailers. 

Discussion
This post may seem obvious to some, but I hope it reaches someone who finds this information useful. What do you guys think? Do you have another means to find lower singles prices that you are willing to share? Is there a reliable benchmark that we should know about to use for prices? General thoughts?

To attempt to help understand my interpretation of the MB1 inclusion...

  
The effect on the EDH format that I had expected was for MB1 to lower the value of the EDH format. However, the opposite occured. This leads me to believe, and you're welcome to your own interpretation, that the majority of cards in EDH are not worth that much, and the addition of the reprints, while lowering the cost of possible staples, was still able to raise the average value of cards in the format by a measurable degree.  


Pioneer on the other hand, which has a much smaller amount of legal cards that are legal, experienced the effect on the average to higher degree due to the smaller amount of cards.",144,1

0,"If you have spare cash then ya sometime in the near future is probably a pretty good time to get in. IMO, revised duals are exactly the types of cards people start liquidating when times get tough. Although in general I wouldn’t say you’re in that big of a rush.

I don’t think the situation has gotten bad enough that I’d buy right now though. A lot of the US(including all the card stores) is basically closed until May 1st. Furthermore, it’s not like come May 2nd everything in retail just snaps back to normal. Retailers and card stores are probably going to spend the better part of this year crawling back to normal, if that’s even possible. People and stores in general are probably at the start of a yearlong struggle.

FWIW, I’m kind of in the same boat as you. I want some eurekas, a tabernacle, and maybe an unlimited dual or two to round out my legacy collection. I’m not seriously looking at moving major money until end of april earliest. I think we’re just at the start of a rough economic year so i think the magic market has a good deal further to fall.  Therefore,  i'm not in much of a hurry to spend.  Just don't get too caught up in timing things precisely.  If you can exit this year with the cards you want you'll probably get a good price even if it wasn't at the all time low.",38,0
1,"Revised duals have withstood much of the market corrections since 2018. They've fared the market much better than playable legends RL rares and most power nine (besides timetwister).

It's true duals will likely weather this storm as well but too say they are crash proof is shortsighted. we just simply don't know.

I think a few weeks from now will the peak buying time for those wanting to pick up duals, legends/arabians staples, or power nine.

Inventories of Tabernacle,Nether void, Chains, Abyss, all power save timetwister are quite high. I've been watching Card Kingdoms inventory after recent vintage price reductions and noone has bought a single card($400 and up EDH staples) in weeks. They just aren't moving.. many high priced cards with decent minimums aren't getting any bids. meaning a big price correction is coming another 15% drop or so.. is what Im guessing. I think starcity and the big venders will start by running sales of everything like coolstuff is doing now.

3,"Well you certainly picked a strange time to jump in, so it will be difficult for anyone to conjure up a straightforward answer. If you were buying simply for an investment, it would be worth exhaustive scrutiny. Since everything is seemingly closed until at least May, they could possibly go lower; it may be worth your while to hunt for deals over the course of the next month. However, since you are also buying them for play, that's a good enough reason to just go in on them and get your enjoyment out of them. Even if they drop a bit more in the short term, experienced hands would probably say it is a matter of when, not if, they will rise again.",4,0

6,"Wait until the stores that are going to collapse have collapsed and bankruptcy trustees come into ownership of lots of Revised duals. 

Private sellers haven't started unloading yet and I don't think many will. But the market will be flooded with duals regardless.

The absolute best time to buy is in the aftermath of whatever the biggest single dealer collapse ends up being. In a possible future where MTGmintcard collapses tomorrow, but CFB, SCG and KidIcarus survive, the best time to buy will be in 4-6 weeks when MTGmint's liquidators are selling.

In a different possible future where MTGmintcard goes tomorrow, CFB goes under in June and the others survive, July or August is when you should buy.

In any case I expect basically everything to be available for below current buylist prices at some point.

None of this should be taken as any comment on how likely any individual chain is to survive or collapse, I just used 4 names that are well known big players in the market.

I would say these have quite a bit of way to drop still as people are going to be selling their collections just to pay rent, buy food, and generally live as the stimulus checks are not nearly enough to offset job losses especially for those who own large chunks of RL cards. Probably 3-6 months will be primetime to buy as we realize the true extent of damage this virus will do to the economy. Personally I don't think this is going to be a 2-3 month and quick recover... with this having the ability to recur significantly until a large % of population gets it and gives a sort of herd immunity or a vaccine is released the damage will likely be extensive and long lasting taking several years for everything to recover to pre-virus levels.

File an FTC complaint. FTC regulations state that if an online order is delayed by 30 or more days the company has to request confirmation from the customers that they are aware of the delay and still agree to the purchase or issue a refund. Specifically, that if the customer does not respond, they are obligated to issue the refund. Wizards violated this regulation and have made it clear through their inaction and lack of communication that they don't really care about the impact to their customers.

To those that say we're whining/ungrateful and that we can't blame WotC for the global pandemic:

That's not what we're doing, we're blaming WotC for 

1) Not communicating and updating more regularly and clearly about the delays, not explaining the details at all, not justifying the continual release, production, and shipment of new products.

2) Not providing public information about any compensation for the delay, not reaching out to customers to help determine appropriate compensation, then mistakenly providing excess compensation to some customers and deciding not to match that compensation for the rest of us.",158,0

I just think it will take time (3-5 years) for the collector and player market to stabilize.,13,0
3,"Well you see people at your store that have money, you aren't seeing all the people who stopped playing because it is just too expensive. When I played modern I played decks that specifically didn't use fetch lands for this reason. The problem being that my decks were alright  but usually lost to the top tier decks that had $500 land bases. I actually stopped playing for a long time because of this. I was getting bored of standard, I can't stand edh, and modern is just too expensive.",8,0
4,"People get excited to crack a card that is financially better than what they paid. That's true. 

People like buying promo/special versions. Also true. 

It's important that these cards are $20+. This is where things fall apart. The secondary market is super crucial to the health of the game but prices don't necessarily have to be quite as high as they are.",3,0
5,"Firstly, as others have pointed out, these are generally two different groups.  One group wants the cheapest legal version of the card available because that’s the minimum requirement to play, and the other has additional expendable income so they can “upgrade” their decks.

Secondly, lowering prices doesn’t change the existence of a “bling” version of a card.  The one group will still want the rare shiny Masterpiece version of Sol Ring whether it’s $50 or $500.  But at $50 there’s a much larger market for that card.",2,0
6,"I hold both of these opinions and don't find them one bit contradictory.  I like my decks blinged out because I like them blinged out, if it were 50%+ cheaper to do so, I'd still do it, possibly even more.  I have mox diamonds for EDH that if reprinted would go down substantially, I'm 100% okay with this if it means I get more fun challenging games of EDH where most people, or at least more people have the power level of mox diamond in their deck.",2,0
7,"If I opened a pack and got money out of it I'd be happy. This can be achieved with chase showcase cards and collector variants.

I'd be even happier if I didn't have to spend ridiculous money to get base versions of cards to play the deck I want.

This is a collectible card game and some cards should be inherently more collectible and playable in value than others, however, the more playable cards should be reprinted regularly and not at high price points so as to artificially inflate their value.",1,0
8,"""Different strokes for different folks""

The MTG ecosystem is extremely diverse. There are people who literally buy 1 paneswalker/commander deck ever and those who buy an extra case of every product released just to sit on, and everything in-between. 

There is a very vocal group who want TOURNAMENT magic to be financially accessible to all. Arena was wotcs solution to that.... not a very good one, but it is technically free to play. 

There is another group that wants casual cards to be cheaper so they can finish their commander decks and compete with their playgroups arms race. With commander getting bigger every day this group is getting louder. 

Fetch lands are a necessary game pieces in multiple formats. The demand is nearly EVERY magic player(hell, even I want more of them for commander decks) and the supply is limited to 2 sets(one of them a 10$/pack masters set) and an overpriced Secret lair for the enemy fetches. 

Blinging is a completely separate issue from reprints as the point is to use the most exclusive versions of cards, not just exclusive cards. Wotc is doing a great job making desirable premium versions of cards for those with greater financial means to soak up.",1,0
9,"There's nothing stopping you from having both.  That's what foils/full art/secret lair/ etc is for.

Make the ""normal"" one seem too plain and people will love getting the ""bling"" one.  Meanwhile the normal one is far cheaper.

This isn't rocket science, they know they can do it.  The reason they don't is because they hoard ""reprint equity""",1,0
10,">If we all want the financial barrier of entry to Magic decreased significantly, doesn’t the excitement of “blinging out” a Commander deck, or cracking the most expensive new foil mythic simultaneously evaporate?

You can find Birds of Paradise printings for under $7, but foil 7th edition Birds of Paradise is still a $500+ card.  The fact that Birds of Paradise is widely available apparently doesn't diminish the fact that foil 7th edition printings are considered highly desired.  Foil Onslaught Flooded Strand is a >$250 card, even though you can get Khans printings for <$20.

If you show up to a Commander game at a playgroup that allows proxies and all of your fetchlands are Expeditions, you're still the guy whose Kenrith has all ten Expeditions.  It doesn't seem like making the game accessible does anything to diminish the coolness of having collected those cards; if anything, making the game more accessible means more people in the store to impress with your blinged-out collection.

In fact, having a $500 version of a card that other people can get for $7 (e.g. foil 7th edition Birds of Paradise) is *more* of a flex than having a $500 version of a card that other people can get for $80 (e.g. foil Worldwake Jace): it says ""Yeah, I could have got the super cheap version, but I decided to go all-out.""",1,0
11,"I also think alot of folks here undermine the draw of cracking a pack as value aswell. For example, I can buy a fetchland for around $30 dollars, or I can buy a pre release kit for that same $30 dollars. Which is the better value? I come out with more rares and cards from the pre release kit, or just 1 powerful fetchland. I think this is a wedge for alot of folks who want to see there dollar go farther. I think folks would rather take all the money they were going to spend on a single card and instead get much more for it. 

I also think this plays into the question ""whose buying booster packs?"". Most often people say drafters and collecters/flippers are the main consumer. The more frugal buy singles. I think this is wrong. I bet most players have a spending limit when  purchasing,

For example:  the frugal player wont spend more than $5 or $10 on any single card. Instead of spending $25 on the one single card they'd like out of a set, they'd rather buy $25 on booster packs and get several rares and other cards instead. 

Perceived value still exists outside of magic, and if your working your ass off for 16 bucks an hour and justify converting 2 hours of work into a single piece of cardboard vs 4 or 5 booster packs, most people will crack packs.

Which then leads into the issue of double masters. Most players will see the prices of singles in the set as too high even after the price drop.

 For example: doubling season, this card is currently $64 CAD, much too expensive for most folks to drop on a single piece. so Double masters releases and drops the price to $32 dollars, much more affordable. But that same player is still baulking at the price. So then the rational for them is to take that $32 dollars and buy some double masters packs instead to get better value for your dollar. Except that a single pack of double masters is $16 which is comparatively bad value vs a standard set booster. Also that $16 booster could have 2 bulk rares worth nothing. So instead that player is left out and goes and buys some standard set packs at a better perceived value.

12,I actually dont mind money being and entry barrier to formats like modern or legacy. I don't want to play against a junk load of casual bobs in a competitive environment. Whoever wants to participate in sanctioned tournaments should take it seriously and therefore should be willing to invest in a proper land base. There is no necessitiy or requirement to own playsets of all 10 fetches and have access to 2 or more decks. I know people who basically played the same deck for years. If I am that much of spike who needs to always play the tier 0-1 deck of a format then I should accept the risk of stuff being banned.,0,0

You want a hot topic, the reserve list with the exception of like 30-40 (like power 9, empower artifact, gaea's cradle, grim monolith, and others even like food chain and survival of the fittest) are 20-40 bucks or much less.

15,"I frequently hear people say they would like to see the price of x-card (typically Fetch Lands these days) plummet in price so that Magic’s player base can expand. This seems like a very kind and understanding opinion, driven by the desire to have more FUN playing Magic with a larger, more diverse group. I agree with this sentiment, and I have even been one of those people, saying “Wizards, please help lower the financial barrier of entry so that my beloved format (Legacy, Vintage...now Modern) doesn’t die.“

Simultaneously, I see people show up to FNM, or my local playgroup, quite ecstatic about the latest “blinged out” additions to their beloved decks. And even more often at prerelease, or while drafting, I see people crack monetarily valuable cards and their happiness is palpable.

These two things seem contrary to me. If we all want the financial barrier of entry to Magic decreased significantly, doesn’t the excitement of “blinging out” a Commander deck, or cracking the most expensive new foil mythic simultaneously evaporate? What is the middle ground?",0,1
0,"Random thoughts:

It'll be interesting to see what product ultimately gets short-printed.  M21 may not receive another major print run for a while, if ever, since there are few in-person events to encourage buying/cracking.  Mystery Boosters seem like a distant memory given that WotC can't print the upcoming product they've already promised (including Secret Lairs).  JumpStart is a product designed for ~~draft~~ **in-person** **play** at stores, so if I was WotC I'd put my focus elsewhere.

The question for me is whether Double Masters will come anywhere close to its print targets with Texas on fire -- there's almost guaranteed to be shortages / delays there too.",28,0

2,"Just be careful when spending too much on these.  Wizards has acted very shady all year so far in 2020 with their business practices and announcements.  Many times they remain factually correct but the wording, timing, or method of releasing the info has been provocative in terms of financial impact on the market.  There has been artificial shortages creating a heightened yet fake FOMO demand for recent products.  

The bulk of the Jumpstart product ordered my be delayed 1-2 months, this only should matter for right now. In the next 2 months this should not impact the product price at all as a large supply glut of Jumpstart will flood the market just as Double Masters prepared for release. 

This is happening right now with Ikoria Collectors boxes hitting the market right now and bringing down the prices for the two weeks before just as Core 2021 is rolled out.

This happened 2 months ago with the free LGS Mystery Boxes hitting the market within 2 weeks of the Ikoria Collectors boxes release.  Yes Rudy messed up the release day inventory with his large secondary market purchases but it looks like the expected print amount finally hit the markets once Amazon and others began receiving their pallets.  But the artificially created temporary Ikoria shortage drove prices up by nearly $100/box in 3 weeks. 

All of this is timed to coincide with the regular cycle of values going down on the previous set in anticipation of the next product release to ease suspicion of manipulation by WOTC. 

The only true supply impacted product I see for 2020 are the Commander Decks.  I don't think there will be a Commander reprint for the simple reason that the obnoxious bulky Commander packaging is too cumbersome to tie up the printers with given the amount of other products that need to be printed in 2020 that are packaged in regular packs and booster boxes. 

All of this just to say don't allow yourself to be manipulated in over paying for Jumpstart in the next few weeks. More product will hit the market and prices will come down.",6,0

[Per Wotc](https://magic.gg/news/magicfest-cancellation), there will be no large paper events in 2020.  When pressed about 2021, the response has been that the moratorium on 2020 events is based on player safety for COVID19 and they can't make any promises right now.

If there's a vaccine discovered tomorrow and rushed to production, events in January of 2021 might be possible.  That means that any cards currently in Standard have a maximum paper shelf life of about 6 months.  It is highly likely that events in 2021 won't resume in January.  Keep in mind that CFB Events is dissolving, so even if WotC gives the all clear, there will still need to be a lot of paperwork done before an actual Magic Fest can be scheduled.  It's more likely that in a less-than-best-case scenario, events above the FNM level wouldn't resume until Q2 or Q3 2021, and everything that's currently in Standard rotates in Q3 2021.  That cards from IKO are never legal in a Standard Magic Fest is entirely within the realm of possibility at this time.

To put it simply, there's no demand for paper Standard cards now, there will be no demand for Standard cards for the next six months, and only in a very good case scenario will there be demand for paper Standard cards before they rotate next year. 

While many players may not be aware of the 2020 moratorium, I think enough of them know that there's no Magic for awhile yet and will be reluctant to move on Standard cards at rotation.

But this part of this post describes what I think how the future looks like :

„

...
In parallel I’m also playing Yu-Gi-Oh mostly just for fun and nostalgia reasons but I already owned a Tier 1 deck and played in some tournaments (highlighting „owned“) . 
So I’m some how educated when it comes to the „Economy“ of the Japanese Cardgame. As we all aware, Konami is well known for its philosophy to reprinting staples in to oblivion (In special boxes) until they worth not more than 10€ for a frequently played 3 off tournament card staple . On the top of this Konami introduced in 2019/20 a rarity (Starlight Rare / Collectors Rare) where staples (yes they picked frequently played tournament staples ) are printed as lottery cards in boosters so artificially rare, that the prices of these versions are so ridiculous high that the most expensive staple (card is not older than 2y) can compete with some FBB blue generating Duals (older than 15 years). Before this newer, more rare and flashier rarity was introduced, Konami had a lot more (former) high end rarities wich also outshined the older ones before (Secret Rare , Ultimate Rare, Ghost Rare). 

The arrival of the newer and more limited rarity , wich is now the Starlight/Collectors rare, was followed by the immediate outshining of their less limited version. What will outshining it in the future ? Konami wants to make money and they are showing this to their playerbase so obviously that they also reprint ban-worthy cards some months before the real ban happens to milk the rest out of them. (Thats why my deck isn’t t1 any more)

What we now witnessing is the beginning of the exact same approach. Wizards is copying this from Konami. More and More flashy versions entering the marked in form as a boxtopper or foil versions in collectors booster displays or secret lairs. Also bannings in Standard are also decided more clearer by considering financial reasons (of course wizards wants to make money ). 

„

The thing is my (family &) friends playing now competitive YGO. They stopped playing after School (age was somehow 14)but as they saw how I’m playing MTG (for me now almost 14 years) competitively they somehow got back in to the game 3 years ago. So basically I’m playing magic on my own with people of my lgs . But now there is a chance for me to enjoying again a tcg with my „real“ friends ... 

Now with this development of MTG im considering quitting mtg(finance) or just buying cards wich I’m enjoying the most. Basically this is what I’m doing in YGO : if there is a alternate version I’d like to enjoy, I buy it only with the knowledge that it can be worthless tomorrow. It’s never meant to get back money out of it or make profit! 

These are at the moment my thoughts how i will approach in the next years. Hope that it will helps you",3,0
10,"The shit started to flow freely into the bed as soon as they started bastardizing and inserting other pop culture references into the game. Making gimmicks packs that include extra rares and special art, all stuff that adds no actual gameplay value but forces you to spend more on the game.

Adding TWD and Godzilla among other brand into the mix shows how willing they are to cash in any way possible.",5,0

Here's something you may not have thought enough about Magic players who returned to the game: the reason they quit the game the first time around.  For some it is what you are thinking now.  Yet, there is something that brought them back.  Coupled with new players that join, the overall playerbase just keeps growing.

You may quit now, but I suspect you will return at some later date.  That's normal.  People do burnout.  What's unfortunate is that you will miss out on stuff in the meantime.  Then in the future you will complain about the need for reprints of the expensive stuff you missed.",18,0

14,"The best thing about magic (so far) is that if anything ever gets too ridiculous, you can just take a break for a couple years and essentially come back to an entirely different game if or when you decide to do so.    

I'm of the opinion that, regardless of any economic hardships or Hasbro/Wizards insanity, there will never be a shortage of amazing people in our community that are willing to step and and make new content, or open a store etc, regardless of the current state of the game.   Peaks, valleys and all that of course, but time has proved the game is just too damn good to ever actually kill outright.  Wizards will make mistakes and game stores will suffer because of it, but that dream of opening a successful game store to carve out a career as a purveyor of the greatest game ever created is just too strong to discourage people, reason or facts be damned. 

I'm NOT a fan of magic as a player or seller right now, but I'm optimistic about the future.  There's no other industry I can think of that you can literally turn your inventory off, do something else for a year or 2 then come back to massive gains on that inventory.  For every set reprint that drops value, there's a new card that makes card x triple+ in value, whether it's a rare or a bulk uncommon from Amonkhet that's now $4.  I just don't ever see that changing, the fever is just too strong.

I can remember dropping 2k on a set of 40 dual lands while in college. I purchased every duel deck to have ready to teach new friends. I picked up every FtV collection. I have multiple EDH, Modern and some legacy decks built. Around the time that masters sets started, I started to struggle to keep up the content that was released, though still grabbed some boxes.

Then toppers and collector sets and direct products became a thing and it became hopeless - there was too much product being pushed. I was ready to pack up and sell everything and just move on.

It seems like the pattern can be boiled down to;
1. Make a chase card that many boxes will have to be opened to fill the decks of competitive players.

2. Ban it around the next sets release so players don’t have the option to sit on it as a deck choice when the next card designed to be chased comes out.

I don’t like it. But to be fair.

Many players have been succesful on reinventing ways to continue playing the game they love without having to feel the greedy corporate Hasbro monster breathing down their necks as we are often used to. Commander was once a new method to keep MTG fun and casual, and to allow players to play with other formats chaff and also powerful stuff that rotated long ago. Now WotC decided to predate on it, so it is natural that some other players will move to other options (chaos draft, pauper, etc). If the question is ""Is WotC bringing a grim future to paper Magic?"" my answer is ""yes, they seem to be trying hard"". If the question is ""Will MTG die?"" I say no, the community has proven from time to time that Magic can continue growing in spite of reckless and blind corporate greed.",1,0

Now the way Hasbro is running the game may not be of my liking. I can just move on and don't get the new products. Maybe I'm not their target audience anymore and they seek a new public. Their approach may actually increase sales and that's why they keep pushing in this direction I don't agree with.

Finance part can just adapt to whatever change that happens. Every crisis offers opportunity. 

Now if a crash happens maybe this is what is needed to change courses. Right now Hasbro is pretty dead on exploring new ways to monetize MTG. We can complain all we want, but it won't change what Hasbro wants from the game. They may just bandage the problem to mask it like every other corporation out there. Only a drastic event will change this direction. Maybe we should embrace a big crash and hopefully a better MTG rises from its ashes.",1,0

I’m sure a lot of you have been following the price of Timetwister over the last couple of weeks. Since so few copies are available on TCG player (only two  at the moment, listed at 3300$ and 7500$), this increase in price has not been visible on sites like MTGstocks nor MTGGOLDFISH. How ever, the price for an PL (HP) Unlimited Timetwister has jumped from 1400€ to 3300€ during the last two weeks on Cardmarket - and similar jump in the US.

The obvious reason is, that Timetwister is used in EDH and that RL fomo led some people to buy their copy now, and afterwards some sellers re-listed with higher prices.

Naturally, both CE and IE stock have declined and increased in price.

If EDH continues to gain popularity, which it definitely will, I am beginning to think that Timetwister (Unlimited Version) within the next 5 years or so could replace Black Lotus, as the most expensive card and sought after card (not talking Alpha and Beta here, since those prices are mostly collector driven).

9,"The new zendikar decks are overall great products. They aren’t super powerful, but are priced accordingly( this matters as any higher of a price point like $40 each would make this an overpriced/bad product). The decks themselves have some synergy and are easily upgradable. The cards aren’t worth much, but a few unopened deck may be worth keeping. 

Honestly this can go both ways for buying/opening mtg product (long term-hold then sell years later strategy). Opening and cracking for singles are no longer financially viable (unless u hit the lottery/flashy/hyped card every time). Holding is a better option, but at that point don’t expect anything more than a small margin (2-5 year period) and a larger margin at (10+ year period). It also has to be a lot of product or you’ll wait 5 years for an extra $10 dollars in your pocket. The zendikar set on the other hand will age badly financially for anything less than a collectors booster or box topper. 

The prices on staple singles are low enough for me to finally play the game with mechanically good cards (mana spree, landfall, draw, etc). The flashy appeal has taken the focus away from the old (regular frame and foil) and into the new (borderless, alternative, showcase foil). The reprints have also contributed to some of these markdowns. The value of a card will return to its playability and synergy. The rarity and art aspect for the collectors market is dead on arrival for recent sets unless u like having 10 different versions/variants of jace.

A high amount of reprints won’t allow cards to skyrocket similarly to how past cards rose in price range, but will also not plummet to pennies and destroy the mtg economy. Rather I strongly believe the market will correct itself and view the cards themselves for their value and it’ll be up to the player to choose which version he/she wants (this won’t affect the price unless there is a huge price swing between certain sets or your getting the original cards). One thing is for sure tho, special land cards (expedition, shocks, etc) will always have a high price tag on them, regardless of which variant/version u have because of its playability.",3,0

With 13€ each these are now below non-core Planeswalker decks. I bought and played both, liked them more than several of the C18 - C20 decks and the included reprints are solid, but not overwhelming.

So why is the product in such low demand?

Some possible answers:

1. 2nd wave (virus, not cardboard) is starting to hit europe.
2. Vendors need cashflow and firesale for minimal returns.
3. Overall sentiment towards MTG products.
4. Misperceived as equal to Planeswalker Decks.
5. Less new cards has lowered demand more than expected - medium value reprints arent that important.
6. Not a lot of hype around the decks - too much product to get attention.
7. Due to limited capacities WotC cant run the usual strategy of scarce 1st wave to push demand into flooding the market with 2nd wave - and the market is confused: ""What, i can buy product right away without overpaying??""
8. Crackers dont have the ressources to buy and flip the product (the amount of offered singles is relatively low).
9. no walkers

4,"Here's the breakdown for these cards.

When art cards are sold, typically the appeal is in collecting a complete set.  Since they serve no function, the appeal is just in having a set of mini arts.  And people like collecting and completing things.

Magic is different in a few ways. For one, the normal cards serve a function.  The appeal of collecting is first in their ability to play the game.  There will always be people who try to complete magic sets, but the ""completion"" aspect tends to be more focused on your own decks.  

So already these have two strikes against them in regards to their appeal to most magic players.

Consider also that people are *especially* turned off to collecting everything right now because of the overflow of products. 

These remind me of when say, a video game releases collectable cards.  Sure, people like seeing the thing they like in other forms, but the appeal is so foreign to the original product, you can't expect much interest.

Despite being superficially similar in that these are both cards, it's the same think.  Nobody really cares about Magic cards that aren't Magic cards.

Because they aren't playing cards, they won't rise in value that much if at all. Vanguard cards are very old, but considering their age, they aren't that valuable and growth rate is very stagnant.

Some of them may have and hold some value, but it won't have growth.

Also another consideration is the next batch of art cards probably will have a different gimmicky that would make it more attractive like real signatures or maybe something crazy like real pieces of the original artwork or some shit, so those printed signed ones will become less special.

Maybe in the future opinions on them shift for some strange reason and turn them more desirable to more people, but I see more downsides than upsides.",2,0

Each year these grading services add more and more to ensure the graded cards are authentic, and even since I graded some cards a few years ago some of those costs have doubled.  Selling an authentic card in a graded case is much harder for a buyer to scam, so offers a bit of deterrent as well.

For that reason I typically say anything above a 5 is a candidate for grading - if you plan to hold onto it for a while.",1,0

2,"I see a bit of a risk hierarchy, that coupled with price and opportunity, may help make appropriately proportioned speculations...

**EDH + Modern Staples -** If a card is a Modern staple, and also excellent in EDH - I've kept it throughout 2020, and will continue to hold until paper play returns (risk of reprint may be high, but I'm largely ignoring that). 

* Force of Negation is one of the few cards I actively snagged as they bottomed, and a strong example card (with a high risk of MH2 reprinting unfortunately..)
* Other examples I've liked: Blood Moon, Eladamri's Call, Walking Ballista
* I see a trend in EDH toward higher comfort with powerful effects, with combos, with tutors, and with denial cards. There is still plenty of salt, but more and more players are becoming ok with a bit of well-seasoned hate.
* MH1 is still teeming with EDH + Modern cards worth a look

**Pioneer + Modern Staples** \- A rung down in the risk hierarchy are cards that are Modern staples and also excellent in Pioneer (and not too critical for EDH)  I don't have a clear picture yet on the best examples of this that are also good pick-ups, but Fatal Push and Thoughtseize are solid examples of the type of card. (just not sure the 2XM copies are a good buy or not). And Aether Gust is another example, but seems way too abundant already.

* The risk with these cards is buying too soon, just like the OP is highlighting
* By being both needed for Pioneer and Modern, these cards do have a bit of risk mitigation
* But really, the paper magic return is likely not right around the corner...

**Modern Exclusives** \- the highest risk category, and the one I'm staying away from for a bit longer. But damn wouldn't it be cool if Engineered Explosives became a $20 card or better? It's a terrible example, as the card has had several printings, and the meta, but still, it illustrates the dream and dangers does it not?",13,0
3,"I think it’s hard to understate how troubling the mere existence of MH2 is. MH1 was a colossal mistake, and the mere existence of a follow up set makes my stomach turn. WOTC doesn’t care one bit about format stability to power level, in fact they seem hellbent on pushing both to the limit because they think it makes them more money to force players to switch decks, but really it just leads to a dead format that no one plays because they can’t stomach the idea of investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a deck that could be invalidated at any moment just for the sake of temporarily driving up sales.",4,0
4,"I think there’s a 5 too:

Kaladesh Standard was a nightmare too and cards were banned in...

• January 2017 (Emrakul, Copter, Reflector Mage)
• April 2017 (Cat Combo)
• June 2017 (Aetherworks Marvel)
• January 2018 (Energy, Ramunap Red)

While you correctly attribute the stability of Modern as a reason for its popularity post 2016, the instability and poor gameplay of Standard matters just as much, if not more. There’s not as much compelling reason to play a stable format if there’s a stable format that’s much less expensive and mostly as fun.  As an example, all the bannings in Modern have made it turning over multiple decks as costly as a couple of dual lands (the entry to Legacy) but Legacy itself has been not been entirely stable and free from the same nonsense Modern has so it’s not offering much for its high entry price. If it did, people might be more willing to go there even though it’s $$$.",11,0
5,"I see a fair degree of migration from Modern towards Legacy and towards Pioneer, for different reasons.

Pioneer offers Modern players what a pecentage of modern players always wanted- what they might call a ""no bullshit"" format. A format where staples are pretty much easily accessible, where power level is relatively low, where a lot of decks are either aggro and if combo gets to be widely played -regardless of the results it puts up- it gets a visit from a Mr Ban Hammer esq. Combo is tolerated at the margins, and control is at the margins- they can be played,  but they are not good enough to make an evening of FNM a grind vs the equivalent of Snowko in Legacy. Prison- of any form- is almost non existant, outside of brewers building around a few key cards, and 90-10 % matchup lotteries are rare, unlike Modern, which has, from the very outset, always had the Soul Sister or Martyr proc vs Burn and Shoal Infect vs Tron type non matches.   It is also a format where the gap between lower tier and higher tier is smaller than Modern, very attractive to some, very samey to others. Nobody is going to claim Pioneer as their favourite format, but there have always been Modern players who \*hated\* Twin, for example, or Pod. Others have always hated 8 rack, Top control etc, and latterly Urza.  In fact, a fair portion of Modern's player base only played it because they saw Standard and wanted something different but could not comit to Legacy due to the prices. Remember fetches were cheap at the outset, and only shocks were truly expensive- it was a different era, one where some people starting off in the format moaned about Ensnaring Bridge, Blood Moon etc being legal right from the start. No format has been moaned about as much as Modern.  As a historically cheap entry point Pioneer it is the sort of format you can buy into without committing, and it will take some Modern players in paper, even if not online.

A small portion of Modern's base have seen the $$££ crash, and their collection value has been shat on, whilst the requirment for spending on new cards that might be banned has continued unabated. MH1 really upset players- Hoogy et al. They have seen the reprints, and been burned financially, whilst the format often burned as an experience.  Some of those players have been expressing interest in Legacy, where RL has kept prices high, but reprints have lowered other cards as in Modern. It is true that RL prices are now ludicrous, but Legacy offers a hugely enthusiastic community, increasingly running unsanction proxy events,  and some great decks are RL free and cheaper than ever, such as  D n T. Many old Legacy staples like Show and Tell have crashed via reprints, and with duals also usable in EDH, and Astrolabe working overtime in blue soup decks, £350 for a U sea or 120 for a  Savannah does not seem so bad. Cards like Tabernacle and Moat have a cache, but they are not essential for many decks. The last challenge had burn in second place- nigh on 20 mountains and good old fashioned burn spells, cheaper than the Modern version. In America, which has always had an emphasis on Legacy as a competitive tour experience , it might be different, but in Europe and Japan etc. Legacy is strong and attracting interest and strong sales, mainly becuase it has the best answers as a format and a community who are not as driven to play the best deck in paper mtg. 

It is in WOTC interest to make Pioneer work. I don't think they care either way about Modern and Legacy- MH2 added as much to both formats and like most sets had lots of EDH able stuff. If they had to chose one to keep it might be Modern, but given the grief they get over it, I think they will let them run their course. I would expect both formats to survive online, but in paper I think Legacy will be kept alive as a niche format by its community, whilst Modern will not.",7,0
6,"Agreed. There's just not much of an appeal to Modern now as a format or really constructed as whole. The big draw to Modern as an ""eternal"" format was that you'd put in the up-front cost of putting more into your deck than with Standard, but it would be viable for a longer period of time. That's just no longer the case. There's been such a drastic shift in power with new staples seemingly printed every other set the last two years. 

It's just not worth it to keep up any longer as player, especially if your deck is suddenly not viable in the current meta or worse gets banned out from under you. 

I'm going to keep the pieces I might be able to port over to Legacy or into my CMDR decks, but I have zero interest in keeping the majority of the ""staples"" I've collected over the past 5 years. My plan is to absolutely sell out of the vast majority of these to a GP vendor once those are viable again. 

I'd say the real moneymaker right now is anything EDH related. That stuff is not going anywhere in the near future and demand is just extremely high across the board. Even something like Smothering Tithe, which was reprinted in a pre-constructed deck, is above $20 right now.",5,0
7,I can't believe that no one has stated the biggest hole of your entire argument - the fetch lands are being reprinted at rare. Modern runs on fetch lands and they lacked a meaningful reprint in spite of the cute crap WOTC pulled. The reprints of fetch lands means that not only will the barrier to entry be reduced but that some cards will become the new choke points. Another user posted about grabbing useful modern cards that are EDH stars and I think that is the safest option.

In short, it was never really that amazing, it just got overblown and was very warping. Uro comes off as similar: if the recent modern challenges are anything to go by, the meta is adjusting.

Buy cards like \[\[Druid of the Ilysian Grove\]\], Uro, Farseek, Cryptic Command, Pact of Negation, Force of Negation, Sakura Tribe Elder, Thalia, Crucible of Worlds, Dark Confidant, Noble Hierarch, and shocklands.

I have a feeling WotC is going to want to crank up the Modern hype this year because MH2 is coming, but I'm not sure how they will do this. Probably the main thing that will sell MH2 is fans of Commander and this might be how they pivot the marketing angle. I don't think the set is going to do well because people don't have much confidence in Modern and there won't be enough Commander cards to make EDH players excited.

I hope this is the last MH set for awhile, and WotC backs off some. They saw how much they can make off of EDH, so maybe they will make 2022 another Year of Commander. If they keep shaking up Modern, they are going to kill the format. I will play EDH and wait and see what happens.",1,0

2. New sets are pushing the power level. It felt like it kept getting warped by new cards to me. Phoenix (Red 3/2, I am having trouble remembering the name), Oko, Hoggak, Uro now it sounds like.

3. Reprints, it can all be reprinted.

I dumped all my modern cards to buylists the last few months and picked up alpha cards. Wheel, Copy Artifact, Balance ect.

I was previously a big modern player. Got into it right when it started (it took a while for modern to take off) and had 5 -6 top tier decks and played in GPs up until 2018. Then I just shifted to sealed and limited as the format just started moving too quickly for what I wanted.

It’s nice that the non-fetch cards are cheap now but throwing good money after bad seems like a poor choice of what to do with your cash.  

The future of Modern may even depend more on the future of Wizards sanctioned competitive play, and if they trend towards more Arena and Historic for the non standard format rather than paper formats, and maybe even sanction Historic in paper, Modern might not be on the 2022 slate at all.

Outliers like the $9,500 Workshop would also become less relevant in an equal-weight portfolio.",1,0

It could very well be this store has pulled something shady. I don't know. So, thanks for the heads-up that people may want to be wary.

However, as someone who has built/revised multiple online stores, let me tell you that integrating with inventory is not something most stores do very well. Often, their online systems and on-site true inventory system might only sync once a day...or might never sync, and online inventory quantities must be adjusted by hand (when they remember to). This is often a problem when stores list the same quantities on multiple platforms to increase exposure.

With these problems, it's very common for a sudden interest in a product to result in overselling. The inventory problem may not be discovered until they dig through their back orders. If they discover they've oversold, many stores will try to scrounge up spare inventory to fill the order and make you wait without saying anything. Very unprofessional, but in their anxiety they don't want to risk losing a sale by actually informing you of what's going on.

But again, I don't know what happened in your particular case. Just given what I've seen behind the scenes of a handful of stores though, I think inventory mismanagement is more often the cause of these problems rather than an attempt to profit more off of a spike.",11,0

Another interesting anomaly is OGW. Despite being incredibly popular due to eldrazi literally creating their own modern deck, the prices for modern staples remain stupidly low.

1,"In my years it’s usually safe to say the original version is only slightly affected by reprints unless it’s in a standard set. I’m not an expert on this stuff though by any means so I’m sure there are tons of other variances and factors that can influence these things. I do have some examples though!

Look at [[jace, the mind sculptor]], then [[idyllic tutor]] or [[ugin, the spirit dragon]].

Worldwake jace has a premium over the several reprints, while each reprint is close to the same between them. This is usually just an availability thing though, and less available in general due to not being in a standard set, so already holds an extra premium due to the price of entry for the reprint sets. A lot less worldwake copies in the world compared to the other reprints, and most folks will usually just buy the reprint because it’s being offered for less than the original.

Morningtide idyllic tutor, and I would think most with different arts throughout its reprint history, has a premium over its standard reprint due to both supply and art, but the original price has dropped significantly since the reprint. It will never be close to the same price though because of the art.

Original ugin though has the same art as reprint ugin, and you see that in price as well. Very close to reprint price. Of course this doesn’t factor in the new bling versions and such. That’s a different discussion.

I don’t know enough to answer each question though, but thought I would share what I know at least. In general, time makes prices go down as demand for these things change to the newest set releases. So commander legends and associated reprints have a little time still. The biggest caveat to that is when a new big deal thing arrives that makes these other things gain renewed interest, and this new demand causes price to go up as supply goes down. Economics lol",4,0

8,"Let me start with the caveat that general trends may likely not apply to 2020 releases, but I'd still like to understand the general trend, as well as specific info on 2XM and other 2020 releases.

**General trends:** My understanding from reading this subreddit is that the *reprint versions of cards* (e.g. the 2XM version of \[\[Dark Confidant\]\]) are typically at their low during the first couple weeks of release (I guess because people are racing to the bottom to liquidate their initial box openings?), while *new cards* in regular print-run products usually are at their low when peak supply hits the market (post-allocation) and/or when rotation happens (unless it's a hot card in EDH).

However, I can't seem to find an answer regarding when the lows happen for *prior printings of reprinted cards* (e.g. the MMA printing of Dark Confidant, or even the RAV printing, depending on how artwork factors in). It seems like the price comes down more slowly for OG printings than they do for the reprint. True? What is the general timeframe for the best time to buy OG printings?

**Double Masters:** Looking at the price graphs on MTGStocks, it looks like a lot of the OG printings of the 2XM reprints are reaching their lows, based on the slight flattening I'm seeing after the decline. For example, Dark Confidant experienced a steady decline since July when it was around $45-$50, until it reached $30 around the beginning of December, where it has remained flat since.

That said, I don't fully trust those graphs. Do you guys feel like 2XM reprints have hit their lows? Or is the recent wave of holiday VIPs going to push them even lower now? I'd love feedback from anyone who has sales data to confirm (or contradict) what the graphs seem to be indicating!

**Other 2020 releases:** Of the other releases this year, which of them have reached their lows and which am I too late on?

Or I guess the first question is.... which actually had a significant enough impact on prices? Neither Mystery Booster, Jumpstart, nor The List seemed to have had much impact on prices of OG printings, though there's some exceptions (such as \[\[Selvala, Heart of the Wilds\]\], which was around $40 and is now sub-$20). The ones I've homed in on are:

* THB - \[\[Idyllic Tutor\]\]
* C20 - a half dozen or so cards, notably \[\[The Locust God\]\]
* M21 - a good half dozen cards, notably Ugin and Azusa
* ZNR - \[\[Lotus Cobra\]\]
   * In the commander decks, Omnath, Sygg, and Oona

What about Commander Legends? Has it been out long enough? I'd love to pick up Lorwyn copies of \[\[Rings of Brighthearth\]\]!

What about CC: Green? Is it a limited enough product to not have much impact on OG printings?",14,1

It's also now an incredibly stupid idea to invest in any of these considering how much pimp is now being printed.  Both of these factors have likely fed into pimp being very cheap these days.  So ya, if you like this stuff then there's never been a better time to buy in cheap since there's just so much of it floating around.  Just don't expect it to hold value like it used to.

I've read through every single post in this topic but no one addresses the actual issue here.  I don't mind paying taxes on my actual profit.  I mean, it sucks and we're already far too heavily taxed for my personal beliefs, but that's a different topic entirely.  What I *DO* mind is paying taxes on gross revenue and not just profit.  The problem with this new change in tax reporting isn't that people are going to be forced to pay tax on their profit, it's that the VAST majority of people aren't going to have a way to prove their cost basis and are going to be taxed to the fullest extent on the entire sale price.  When Joe Blow sells his decade old shoes or clothing or whatever else from around the house on ebay, how is he expected to deduct the purchase price of those goods from what eBay is now saying he ""made""?  Chances are he's losing money overall and simply recouping those costs, but the vast majority of us aren't going to have receipts for the shit we've bought.  Do you have receipts for all of the cards in your collection?  Did you save your walmart, target or LGS receipts for the random 10 packs you bought where you cracked a 50 dollar card that's currently sitting in your binder that you'll maybe sell a couple years from now?  That card wasn't free, but how are you going to prove to the IRS that it wasn't free?  THAT'S the problem with this.  It completely FUCKS OVER common folk and helps the corporations that already have their ducks in a row.  This is the absolute best possible thing that could have happened to StarCity, CFB, CardKingdom etc.  Who among us wants to sell $5 cards on eBay when we need to attempt to track our cost basis on literally every card we sell?

28,"To follow up on my last post.  Does anyone have any actual solutions to this?  I'm open-minded and all ears.  I'd like to continue selling online and I'll pay my tax on profit, just not on revenue.  How can us every day folk possibly and realistically comply with this?  

Lets say I buy a collection of 100 cards for $100.  Lets say I keep some of that collection for my own purposes because those are the cards I wanted, and I sell $75 worth of cards from the collection to recoup the cost of said collection.  Like most collections, the cards will be variable value.  Some of those cards might be worth 5 cents, others 5 bucks, and others 20 bucks.  How the hell do I possibly report this where I'm not paying tax since I'm not actually making a profit?  And before you say ""your cost basis for every individual card is $1, so you pay taxes on each card you sell for over $1"", no, you're wrong.  In this instance I spent $100 and sold $75 worth.  I'm not making a profit and haven't made a profit.  

And that previous example is an incredibly basic example.  What about a huge collection of thousands of cards?  What about cards you pull from packs?  What about cards you currently have in your collection already that you've had for years or decades that you couldn't possibly provide a cost basis for?

Again, I'd love some actual realistic solutions to this problem but I don't see any.  Not unless you're an actual business doing hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue and you can afford employee(s), accounting software and accountants.",2,0

But I have observed recently cases for price deltas both ways - for example singles for certain products may be in high demand in EU, like english language or secret lair singles for some products because it was just harder to get those without significant shipment expenses.

It might take a few minutes to determine a value and post it to TCG, and they now have to monitor TCG at least once a day to go through and ensure that there has not been a price shift that requires them to adjust their posting.

Say they can upload 20 cards in an hour (maybe a few more, maybe a few less), they now have roughly 20 hours ahead of them for just cataloging those $1 cards.

Now think about the work they have to do to observe those postings every day, and the time involved in that.  If they spent $1000 on your bulk, spent 20 hours cataloging, and spend time applying postage to sold cards and monitoring the site daily, they may have one hundred hours (or more) invested into their $1000 purchase just to make $1000 profit out of it, assuming the market did not change and they sold everything at market value.

1,Enemy fetch lands are 100% in MH2. And my guess is there will be a super hyped new borderless version in collector packs. They will without a doubt drop for normal framed enemy fetch lands. Your expedition may get a pull back in price but not like what a normal framed misty will.,10,0

Edh players want them, modern players want them - they will dip for maybe a few days and sell out just my 2 cents",7,0
3,"I would recommend selling fetches now if you don't plan on using them in the near term.  As Rudy would say, you have to look at the odds on both sides.

The odds of expedition fetches going UP in the next 6 months is very minimal.  Zendikar Rising is still in print.  Box Toppers come with every box.  Collector Boosters come with an average of 4, and are still available for $184 even 7 
months after release.  So you have ample supply in the market, with distributors still having plenty in stock.  This puts an effective ceiling on some of these prices.

Then you have MH2 coming along on top of ZNR with fetches at Rare.  While product prices are higher, distributor checks show supply is decent - at least they are allowing a good amount of pre-orders right now.  We also have 4 product variants of MH2 this year (Bundles, Collector Boxes, Set Boxes, and Draft Boxes) as opposed to just 1 in MH1.  A lot of this product will be opened even at higher prices.  A lot of fetches will be fetched.

These factors make it difficult for fetches to appreciate significantly in the near term.  There is a bigger risk they will fall, perhaps significantly.  Keep in mind Polluted Delta dropped down to $13 with buylists under $10 back in 2015 and Khans, and even last year you could find copies under $20 in ebay auctions.  We've only recently seen spikes towards $40 and as with many other recent spikes, does not appear to be sustainable - arbitrage will begin to kick in and lead stores to crack more boxes to fill the demand at these inflated prices.  

The original expeditions still reign king, so they may survive this assuming MH2 doesn't introduce some sort of super bling, ultra rare version that takes over.  But all other revisions - I expect to see a dip, if not a flatline until MH2 supply starts drying up.",6,0

Probably a common issue on here, but I recently picked up a box of Modern Horizons to sit on for a while ahead of MH2s release this July, and when it arrived from Amazon it was pretty beat up.

To be clear - I don't believe it is resealed or searched. Even the corner rip would be pretty hard to get the packs out of without warping or ripping further. If this had a box topper, I'd be very concerned.

The foil at $40 is a very risky purchase as this is a rare.

I've been scammed twice recently on getting a Doubling Season, waiting almost 2 months total to get my money back at this point. Each seller at the time of me buying it only had their prices about $3-4 lower than all the other sellers, and their feedback was good at the time, but as the days went on they started getting more and more negative feedback from customers because they never sent cards or responded to messages.

I got my money back on the first Doubling Season, but I'm still waiting on the second one. It's been 9 days since I messaged TCGP about it directly and I haven't heard anything yet. I'm pretty frustrated.

A few booster packs isn't really a great spec from a finance stand point. are you looking to open them and hope you get more than you paid back? If that is the case it's probably a bad idea.

3,"The way market works in general rarely applies to alters due to how unique each one is so it's not really a finance related post and might get removed later.

That said I have some expierence buying and selling alters and one thing I can tell you is that alters prices are totally subjective to the artists. The only factor that can help determine minimum price is the card's price by itself and alters usually go for more than their price. The price over the card's price covers for materials and time spent so a lot of the times the more is painted, the more it costs.

In general if you like the alter just buy it. There's no additional finicial advice since you're very unlikely to resell it later. You could also contact an artist for a commision of your choice which gives you control over how it looks but may look different due to paintes tecnhique and price can also be higher or lower.

TL:DR - There is nothing really to think about alters in terms of finance. If you feel you can spend some money on unsellable art piece on your card then go for it if not then don't.",2,0

2,"I've bought a large majority of my RL cards, including dual lands, from eBay over the past 5 years. I've only encountered one fake out of ~20 cards, and it was easy to notice. At the same time, nearly all of my purchases have been within buylist to TCG low for a range of conditions, even up to LP. NM is a slight yellow flag, but I wouldn't let it deter you much.

Overall I'm a fan of eBay. Buyer protection (and PayPal) is there to step in if something goes awry.",1,0
3,"I would push back on the cards being playable by almost anyone. First-time handlers of older cards will have issues, but fake duals all fail the light test, many don’t have the correct border size, the finish is super waxy/glossy, and the images are all yellow or grainy depending on which of the two major vendors you go with. Contemporary cards look very convincing in sleeves, but old border cards, especially duals, are amongst the worst counterfeits.

Now there’s nothing stopping a seller from shipping you a counterfeit while having used pictures of a real card for the listing, and for that reason I would avoid low-feedback sellers. Ebay’s customer service is getting really slow and I’m quitting the platform due to recent bad experiences with high end purchases and sales, but I wouldn’t worry specifically about counterfeit duals.",1,0
