0,"I thought that was an excellent interview. Trace Mayer brings up some interesting facts. 

I was about to subscribe to the idea that Bitcoin supply is inelastic and that could influence the price positively even if it is currently inflating at a constant rate. But the supply that actually matters, is the supply on the exchanges. And this is an elastic supply. For example, there is an abundance of Bitcoin on the exchanges at the moment, because ETH has been doing so well, and people have been making loads of BTC. So there is an oversupply of BTC because everyone is making money on ETH it seems. This causes downward pressure on BTC-Fiat price, because fiat is still the go-to currency if you want to consume. And the people who took profit, are expected to cash some of it out. Which is why BTC->Fiat is likely going down. However, in the beginning when ETH peaked, it was some serious drops. People didnt care, they just wanted some cash, right now. But right now, it seems they are timing it. Everytime there is a top, there is a sell.  The next phase will be, that every time there is a top, there is going to hodling instead, because most of the excess BTC will have changed hands into the hodlers.",2,0,1459413013.0

0,"Autos and Housing are hugely different.

There are no protections for auto buyers. Miss a payment and your car can be repossessed the next day. Most subprime autos have trackers installed, to simplify the job of the Repoman. 

Miss a mortgage payment? It could be years before the bank is able to reclaim control of their property.

In the housing bubble, there was no care given to the quality of the loans because of the belief that no matter what, the underlying value would continue increasing, enabling future refinances, and insuring (falsely)  that the lenders would be made whole in the event of a default. 

Neither is true about cars. No ones lending on autos thinking ""if they miss their payment, I can just take the car back and sell it to someone else for even more"". Cars are depreciating assets. And this is priced in - when subprime mortgages were just a few hundred basis points over regular mortgages, subprime auto loans were typically at whatever the maximum rate was available in a given state. In Florida, that was 29%.

Further, dealers and financiers build this into their business plan. Some even assume the typical car will be repossessed within 6 months. This lets them basically keep reselling the same car over and over again (or selling the car at auction and replacing it with an equivalent).

No one but no one is investing in auto loans with their blinders on. As said, cars are assets that lose value rapidly, not ones whose values are expected to increase over time. That in and of itself completely changes the dynamic. And no one is trying to hide how awful their assets are when selling them to financiers, there are no ""prime"" tranches of auto ABS's that are actually stuffed full of ""Buy here pay here"" crap.

Lastly, people are far more likely to make their auto payment than their mortgage payment. Fail to make your auto payment and you lose your car, ability to work, etc. And when they do fail and lose their car, they're right back at the same lot getting another car all over again, making a whole new down payment, which is basically the only cash an unscrupulous dealer counts on.

Fail to make the mortgage payment, you move.",2,0,1459433047.0

1,"Accepting credit cards is costly for merchants.  These costs do get passed on to consumers but the consumers don't notice them because they are priced in.

Unfortunately merchants in America have a habit of passing on the costs to *all* consumers, even the ones who don't pay by credit card.

Effectively, the consumers who pay by cash or bitcoin are subsidizing the consumers who pay by credit card. That is not the fault of bitcoin, because it's 100% up to the merchants which payment system they subsidize or penalize.

Outside America the situation is different. In Germany, for instance, merchants hate using credit cards. You often have to pay a 2-3% ""credit card fee"" and many smaller merchants don't accept them at all.

8,"The killer app is a stateless, censorship-resistant money (which is a work in progress).  Not payment network.  Use Paypal or applepay or SWIFT or Visa, etc. for a much better and faster and cheaper user experience.  

You got the wrong idea about what bitcoin is, either on your own, or from someone who does not understand the economics of what is going on here.

The primary short-term value to be had by most users of bitcoin is to be found in speculation.  The holders among us understand that the production of money (without a state decreeing it such by fiat) is something of a public good and fraught with free-rider problems and other externalities.  Holding, among other tactics is a commitment strategy to help overcome these problems more quickly.  With network goods (of which money being the most network-reliant good) demand begets demand, until such time as the token is held widely enough that it can naturally transition into the primary unit of indirect exchange, and then the demand to hold as money augments the liquidity built up by those holding for other reasons, and the price stabilizes in something of a positive feedback loop.

We are not there yet.  Whether or not the Bitcoin network will facilitate the on-chain throughput and ease of user experience to be the payment network of choice for coffee and other everyday retail items, is irrelevant to the primary value proposition of the logical ends of the technology and network effects which have been built up thus far (towards the ends of a unit-of-account money).",10,0,1467259779.0

It has to do with the fact that you are dealing with a system of fees and bs because you are dealing with companies that need to profit off the buying and selling of bitcoin. Just like if you needed to buy some euro with your usd.

Do some work that earns you bitcoins. Ask to be paid in bitcoin and let your employer/contract deal with the fees. Then use those bitcoins somewhere that actually accepts bitcoins, and not through a payment processor.

That is true bitcoin and is not full of hidden costs everywhere. It's the dreamy future of a bitcoin holder. We aren't there yet, but being able to liquidate back into the economy by buying something immediately, just as you would buy with credit card, is going to be the most expensive way to spend your bitcoins, this is because credit cards put the cost of the merchant. There isn't any bitcoin payment processors that do that right now.

Also, bitpay uses an algorithm to determine it's bitcoin price based on daily averages (I believe.. or something like that) it's never going to match any one exchange rate exactly. Just as all exchanges usually are a few bucks off of each other.

If you are a techie in the US like San Francisco, like I am, there's tons of ways to send money to your friends quickly and efficiently. Almost everyone in their 20s and 30s has PayPal, Venmo, Square Cash, or Google Wallet. I can name probably 2 or 3 people tops who would even accept a Bitcoin payment from me, and even if I were asked to be paid Bitcoin for my last Vegas trip with my friends, I'd prefer not to.

You might find a merchant who gives a discount because they don't have the fees/chargeback expenses but you don't get the protection.  People on here often discuss things as if everyone has to use Bitcoin or at least wants to use Bitcoin.  The way to solve this is to increase the use of Bitcoin and the entire ecosystem so Bitcoin is cheaper to use.  However, most people don't focus on these issues as they are involved in endless conspiracy theories.  any attempt to make changes to make Bitcoin more usable is met with stiff resistance and claims it will destroy Bitcoin.  Some people on here actually claim that spending Bitcoin is bad because it the merchants will sell the coins and cause the price to tank (of course if people were using Bitcoin they would also be buying more coins but that concept seems to be lost on some people).  

I agree this is a huge problem but I don't know how to solve it given that any suggestion is met with censorship and conspiracy theories.  Look at the discussion on BIP 75 (this is an innocuous optional feature that allows for refund communications in a secure channel).

Expansion of the dispute ""Terminator Plan"" proposal [Copy link]

Prerequisites:  
1, core version 0.13.1 released in July, including the miners activated segwit (isolation witness) are available;  
2, classic releases new version is based on core 0.13.1 version, including for miners active segwit (isolation witness) and 2M hard bifurcation;  
3, core violation of the Hong Kong expansion consensus agreement, not in August 1, 2016 release includes new versions of 2M hard bifurcation.


Making process:  
1, over 75% of the mine pool owners and operators of power miners Optional Optional day expansion of convening the meeting;  
2, the meeting reached a consensus: all participants ore miners in pools or expansion route choice will work hand in hand;  
3, select a pool of mine as ""Terminator"";  
4, released ""Terminator Plan"" content.

Program content:  
1. Participating mineral pool, miners reach consensus on expansion: 90% or more operators to activate 2M force bifurcation hard to count more than 95% of the force activation segwit (isolation witness);  
2. Participating mineral pool, miners to achieve consensus on the expansion, will be unified planning, unified action, act in unison;  
3, select XX meeting mine pool to ""Terminator"";  
4, in addition to the ""Terminator"", the participants all mineral pools, within 30 days the miners core program switches to the latest version of the classic, complete 2M hard bifurcation, segwit (isolation witness) Operator support force;  
5, if and only if more than 75% of the operator support 2M hard on finalizing the diverging after ""Terminator"" complete support for 2M hard bifurcation as soon as possible to ensure that there are more than 90% of the force operator support 2M hard bifurcation;  
6, when the 2M hard fork is activated, the 28-day grace period, the pool of participants ore miners will do everything possible to inform all the miners, exchanges, wallet developer / company, core wallet users, other start-up companies and other completed core switching procedures to ensure the smooth progress of the bifurcation hard, to avoid unnecessary losses generated;  
7, activate segwit (isolation witness).






Description proposal:  
1. The proposed plan is valid only after three preconditions occur;  
2, which is a majority of the miners to mine the main pool of the proposal, there are different opinions may ignore this proposal, will be idle, bored when I was nonsense;  
3, expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, both parties after a long discussion over, except for a few extreme person, most people agree that the following points:  
(1) We need to 2M hard bifurcation, but requires enough force to support the operator to ensure that Bitcoin will not be split;  
(2) We need to isolate the witness, in order to achieve Bitcoin kernel better scalability and compatibility;  
(3) We need lightning network, in order to achieve Bitcoin-second transfer capability.  
4. Select the Always use classic classic does not mean that later, if the core in a subsequent compatible version adds support for the classic, the miners can then select the core;  
5, core and classic are open source projects, developers fate is freedom, when the miners selected classic, I believe there will be many core developers turn to classic provides code;  
6, the battle line expansion, isolation witness, 2M hard bifurcation debate lightning network has been trouble for too long, please do not argue with me here their advantages and disadvantages, and I do not want to waste time on these topics and the energy;  
7, one of the core design of bitcoin miner is considered the future direction of the force decided to Bitcoin, ""talk harm the country"", the expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, continue to argue it is empty.

I agree completely that we lost the scale of things.  The last two bearish years made people here very...uhmmm...passive (bending over to Core/blocktream and all), as opposed to agressive, ""with impetus"".

If the halving or anything else brings a bubble, with capital B, then we will see 4000 easily.  10.000 possible.  This is my speculation.  But there's a problem...

People are calling a bubble at 2k.  That's not a real bubble. They forgot or are muffled by the Core/blockstream that this under 1000 price is normal, that now bitcoin is less volatile, and growth will be linear, and all other sorts of noise.

We have had terrible price because there's a cap on Bitcoin.  Bitcoin as It is today is limited on Its capacity.  Seven transactions a second Is not even High School level. It's kindergarden level.  The fucking King is naked, guys, just look and see It already.

It's like when a Boeing engineer makes a change in a piece of an airplane and that change alone keep hundreds of terrible accidents from happening.  Nobody will ever know the importance of the change in the piece because the accidents never happened to begin with. 

Now here we are.  One good news and after another and we don't see the price really rising or any bubble or rush in the horizon.  Why is that? We can't see the exponentiality of Bitcoin, or worse, lost the idea of Its exponentiallity, because of a lack of a move that should have been made over a year ago.  And the movie that we see is that Bitcoin is ""less volatile"", Linear, controled.  We see what **is** happening, not what **should** be happening.

Shit, bitcoin hit $1000 because people were willing to pay that price back then for **kicks** and the entryway was the size of a mousehole back in gox times. The new folks on here are fucking SPOILED with coinbase and xapo and circle.

Also, during the last run up, **NOTHING WAS HAPPENING**, no markets were crashing, no bailouts, no bank runs. Sure the economy was shit and trust in the  authorities is ever decreasing but truth be told, the world didn't even actually *need* digital gold back then and it hit $1000.

Did you have a credit card or a debit card? Or did you have a really low limit?

I'm not a big spender, but if you want to rely on $800 of credit only for a vacation, that can be risky. You know how you're always supposed to have money for an emergency? Well, what if you did have an emergency? Would $800 be enough? Would you be able to change your flight in case of a family emergency you had to get back to? I'm not sure if the fault is really the credit card.

Let's take a card I have, the Chase Sapphire card. I have $8000 of credit on there. Not huge, but not small either. I'm not going to put $7200 on the card and hope I have enough to survive on my vacation. I'd use a second card if needed.

Sounds to me you have a debit card here, which isn't the wisest thing to use in the first place unless you have difficulty in managing your money properly with credit.

>This is why I never use my credit card, but unfortunately when you need to make reservations its either present a card or get no reservation. Without a reservation during tourist season on one of the most tropical lush places on earth, good luck on getting that activity done.

Take it from someone who had credit card debt and took years to pull myself out of it. I swore then to never charge up a card again and have never since spent a penny I do not have.

This is why you aren't liable for those charges. Let's say in this month of June you get double charged for a huge charge of $1000. You get 2x $1000 charges on your bill on July 1st, and you say ""WTF man, I'm not paying that."" Well guess what? You don't have to pay up because your credit card (MC, Visa, Discover, AMEX) all have zero liability protection. You don't have to pay while they are investigating it. So no, you're not spending money you don't have and no one is pulling money from your account without authorization.

Look, there's plenty of reasons to not like credit cards, but I honestly think you maybe didn't manage your personal finances properly to begin with.

>Bitcoin Magazine also reached out to one of the authors of BIP 75, Netki CEO Justin Newton. One of the first things Newton was able to clarify was that the personally-identifying information sent in the payment protocol can be seen only by the sender and receiver involved in a particular transaction.

>“We actually added another layer of encryption (at the application layer) as a way to protect against the data being man-in-the-middled,” said Newton.

>According to Newton, a BIP 75 user does not even have to trust his or her own phone or laptop to keep payment info private when a hardware wallet is used.

>Newton also shares similar concerns to Todd and others in terms of a potential slippery slope toward AML and KYC compliance on the vast majority (if not all) of Bitcoin transactions.

I think we can clearly see some political and philosophical differences clashing here. All I see is a opt-in layer 2 protocol that establishes a encrypted data set for those *who wish to use it*.

I think if the BIP could be revised to ""keep the payment info private"" when *any type of wallet* is used, then I would be totally ok with this being merged. It adds some practical achievements that bitcoin sorely needs with no cost attached.

I think this comes down to how you want to use bitcoin. If I want to attach a note to my message declaring who I am, I can do so right now. But I cannot do that with a encrypted note baked into the protocol. That is especially handy for a crap ton of commerce related examples.

If that encrypted data set is used to communicate private information between the buyer and the seller, *who fucking cares* ? /u/petertodd you really blew this one up for no reason.

Your examples are lacking. This is in no way related to blacklists, or tor node logs. This is enabling a feature that is very useful to the majority of bitcoin users. 

You know what impacts fungibility? Using your position of authority to attack developers who are contributing to our community. These developers are also working on privacy enabling features by implementing them into their wallets. And your actions have personally caused damages to them, which means less users will use their wallets built with privacy preserving features. You want to talk about fungibility but where is security baked into the protocol? Where is Open Transactions in the protocol? Where is coinjoin in the protocol? You expect wallet developers to come up with solutions but where are our protocol level solutions?

Next time lay off the coffee and use technical reasoning instead of politicking to accomplish your goal. The merits of this BIP should be discussed in full with revisions that gets the advantages without any security disadvantages attached.

1,"BIP75 doesn't directly threaten fungibility imo. 

 BIP75 does provide a standard for sharing information about who sent funds, but that information is only seen by those involved in the tx. And it's not obvious to any outsider exactly what information was exchanged via BIP75. Such that BIP75, by itself, doesn't decrease the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin - people will still have to rely on blockchain analysis services that already exist (e.g. Chainalysis). 

And BIP75 does open up a number of interesting new features, from sending address/shipping info with a payment to sending certified identity information (which would make traditional financial institutions like banks more comfortable accepting bitcoin payments directly). I'd love to be able to send bitcoin directly to a traditional FI. Sure I'd prefer to not have to deal with standard banks at all, but my reality still involves a good amount of Wells Fargo and BofA and all the rest. My hope is that a direct bank integration (made possible via BIP75) is net-positive for bitcoin.

The longer term fungibility implications of BIP75 aren't obvious. 

As it stands now bitcoin isn't perfectly fungible. Companies and miners have the option of blocking transactions. That's not the norm now, but some government could decide tomorrow that they want miners to stop mining txs from Alphabay, mixing services or exchanges that haven't obtained the 'CountryX-BitLicense'. 

All organizations and individuals with a footprint in any jurisdiction and some link to bitcoin are subject to that jurisdiction's enforcement actions. 

regardless of BIP75. 

And you don't need much knowledge of cryptocurrency systems to understand that something like BIP75 (or something with much greater impacts on fungibility) is possible. 

My belief is that BIP75 is the best of breed option here. And that if bitcoin is ever to see mainstream adoption something like BIP75 is inevitable. So... we're probably better off choosing BIP75 vs. having something more onerous imposed on every exchange and wallet service. bcs there's a chance that BIP75 could get us through the next 10+yrs, letting us avoid a real fungibility crackdown. 

Anyway, there are definitely trade offs here. More users --> more pressure to regulate. BIP75 feels like the right balance to me. In part because I believe that the cryptoasset cat is very much out of the bag. Which means that for those people who want to ride the edges, it's easier than ever (and getting easier). Bitcoin is the tip of the spear - it's not perfectly anonymous or perfectly fungible or perfectly decentralized, but it's still the most powerful freedom enhancing technology of the least 25 years and the more bitcoin users in the world, the better. even if that mainstream version of bitcoin does not meet my (or your) platonic ideal. 

and for those edge cases where bitcoin is not be ideal, other coins will emerge that can meet those needs (zerocash or whatever they might turn out to be). Let's keep being passionate about this technology we love, but let's also remind ourselves that we're all riding this great cryptowave to greater freedom together.

0,"Here's my standard explanation for why I believe Bitcoin to be so revolutionary and important.

The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand *money*. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one *actually* wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are ""just data."" But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs). 

To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is *de*centralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the ""ledger"" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the ""accounting entries"" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective. 

Enter Bitcoin.

 It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than ""modern"" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn't, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.",5,0,1467271065.0

Many people tried from the early 1990s into 2009 to create systems of money based on software rather than edict, and all failed.

The fundamental problem was digital scarcity. It's easy to devise a digital token that two parties agree has some value. A computer file or even a simple text message will do. The problem is how to prevent that token from being copied and spent more than once.

Bitcoin solves that problem and so represents a fundamental advance in both computer science and economics. In fact, it brings the two fields together in a completely new way.

This Central Bank's policy itself is not meant to promote bitcoin (of course). But it will push lots of people to start looking for better ways -- convenient, censor-less, and efficient ways to transfer money. 


Bank transfer is known to be slow, expensive and cumbersome. That's why Alipay and Wechat Payment (Tenpay), the two convenient and (almost) fee-less tools are extremely popular. But now they're strictly limited by the policy. 


It is clear that with this policy in effect, banks want to force people go back and use their already heavily criticized systems. But history never goes backwards. Without Alipay/Wechat-pay, Bitcoin is one of the only few promising choices left to the public. That's why I tweeted it.

2,"Caveat: I'm not a programmer, but I do work a lot with keys and key management.

Based on your post, I'm not sure if you're using seeds or independent private keys. I'll assume for this post you're thinking of using a single seed with multiple wallets and I'm about to explain why I think it's a bad idea. (Also, I'm not talking about restoring one seed to another wallet and then using that one wallet)

One serious risk is that by simultaneously using multiple, unrelated, uncoordinated wallet providers you are taking on the risk of unknown ""bugs"" creeping up. In other words, programmers make choices within the context of their programs. These choices are not universal, all wallets do not implement the same features - for example the same way of calculating fees, the same way of generating and using change addresses. There are standards that provide guidance but when you actually look at them, there is a LOT of room for interpretation as to how you would implement them within existing wallets. If you begin using different wallet providers, with different implementations, I think there is a significant chance that *something* will go wrong. And if it does, it will be your fault - not the multiple wallet company's -because they don't generally anticipate (nor do they design for) users to use keys in this way. Also, you could run into issues with gap limits (described below).

To your questions, in theory, Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients (most wallets) should check UTXO (for bitcoin associated with your keys) each time you open the app or launch the browser extension or website. Change addresses are built, like your other receive addresses, from the seed. For many implementations the ""import wallet"" function is different from the day-to-day SPV client function. Meaning the only time a larger ""look for"" UTXO function runs is at import. 

It's impossible for wallet software to check every possible address for a given seed - there are 2B plus possible keys per branch per child. So it's my understanding that programmers set a ""gap limit"" - in order to enable them to find keys with UTXO associated. Ever notice that some wallets won't let you create new addresses until you've used the previous one? The gap limit is why. When restoring a wallet (or importing, or sweeping a wallet), the software first needs to identify what keys on the tree have UTXO locked to them. It can't search everywhere, so it searches for addresses in a specific way (based upon standards and how the wallet itself provides addresses to users). It will start at the beginning of each branch that the programmers expected might have UTXO (for example 44'/0'/0'/0/1 branch) and it might look at the first 15 public addresses (for example, 15 is not a required number). If there is no UTXO locked to any of those addresses, the software interprets that to mean the branch is unused and will not continue checking down that branch (remember it can't check every address). This could pose a problem because if you use different wallets and they each use different branches and implement different gap limits, then the wallets might not ""see"" all of your UTXO. They might not even look at other branches after you import your seed. 

One of the other commenters said that their family uses Mycelium shared. In this context, that poses less of a problem because the choices of the Mycelium programmers are consistent with all uses. There is still the risk of loss of one device but it seems they are comfortable with that risk. It's much more likely you'll have trouble if you use multiple wallet providers, which I think is what you were asking about. 

If you give us more about what you're trying to accomplish then maybe there are other, safer ways to do it. I'm sure I haven't covered all of the risks and there are probably other issues too but hopefully you'll get a better idea of why I think this isn't being used more often. Also, each time you type in your seed words, they are less secure - due to key loggers etc. I really like hardware wallets for key management, if you haven't considered them yet, maybe take a look.

Also my spendings should synchronize back to my other wallets and reflect the amount I actually still own, or is there anything I am overlooking? Will this pose a problem if change gets involved?

Exchangers (e.g. Coinbase) are defined as money transmitters and in all circumstances. Administrators (i.e. miners) are only considered money transmitters if they sell what they mine for USD.

Technically, there is no DIRECT requirement within Title 31 Chapter X (BSA/AML) for money transmitters to collect full identifying information ( name, TIN, DOB, physical address). The only DIRECT obligation which impacts BTC exchangers is technically the ""travel rule"" which requires information regarding finds transfers for $3,000 or more.

However, MSBs also have anti money laundering program requirements that dictate ""risk based"" internal controls. Which is why companies like Coinbase get full ""Customer Identification Program"" required data. The regulators ( in their case - the IRS and various state banking agencies) see a risk and make them mitigate with what they deem to be sufficient policy requirements.

If what you mean is that merchants accepting BTC have no requirement to identify their customers...I'd say it depends. If the merchant looks to convert BTC-USD daily, they may engage a company like Coinbase to process for them. And if thats the case, Coinbase may ask for some, albeit more limited, merchant client/transaction data; not just for AML but to cover their fraud claim loss exposure just like a bank would with a third party payment processor. On the other hand, if a merchant is holding funds in their wallet and periodically converting back to BTC, they would have less indirect regulatory scrutiny",3,0,1467330540.0

In reality, the Internet, kind of like Bitcoin, has no rulers. (And the CEO of ICANN was trying to tell the congressmen this in the hearing, but they didn't get it...) Although ICANN has de facto universal control over the DNS root zone and IP address allocation, this is only by convention. You could set up a separate DNS root zone right now, and ISPs could use their own IP address allocation systems. This would run the risk of making the Internet less of a single continuous space, but it's entirely possible to do. The only reason that nobody's really put much effort into trying something like this is that that ICANN has done a pretty good job overall.

Also, I think that the ICANN organization is reasonably good. They seem to have a pretty pro-freedom, hands-off attitude. One of the previous CEOs of ICANN wrote the book *The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations*, and the current chairman of the board invented the IETF RFC process (which Bitcoin's BIPs are indirectly based off of). I suppose it's possible that ICANN could somehow be co-opted by the UN or something, but I don't think that it's likely to happen anytime soon, at least, and if it does happen then as I mentioned previously ICANN has no power except what people freely give it.

Maybe Bitcoin could even learn some lessons from ICANN, since ICANN's (and the IETF's) task is similar to the task of developing the core Bitcoin network. Like Bitcoin, the Internet itself is totally decentralized, but quite a bit of coordination is necessary to keep the network in one piece.

Seems crazy they would prohibit people from having accounts based on what their job is..

Update:

I got a call back early this morning. They didn't change their decision or anything and it was explained to me that the account was closed because I made ""bitcoin related transactions"" which would be sending some money to my personal coinbase account.

He tried to tell me that there are regulatory tracking requirements for such transactions, which I know there are not and told him so, then he changed is to a hypothetical issue if there where some kind of audit process performed. So I told him that this is the same type of transaction as if I sent my money from their bank to any other regulated financial institution, like sending a transfer to a credit union account and having my bank account closed in response because the credit union is a competitor.
The response to this analogy was about virtual currency regulation, and I did not send very much and know well the laws involved, so I explained that both the amounts I sent would require no special licencing in the state of Maine, or federally, and even if it did the financial institution actually selling bitcoin is not your bank, which is akin to closing my account because I purchase liquor with my bank debit card from a store, and my account is closed because the bank does not have a liquor licence. This is when his tone changed, he either seemed to give up on lying to me, or he didn't get it to begin with and all of a sudden ""got it"".

Anyway, I don't care that much about the account and it is being closed anyway. I think this stuff is going to start happening a lot more in the US, and I wonder what the repercussions will be like for the banks, and how long it will take for them to stop fighting it.",20,0,1475260838.0

and coinbase is no release my coins right away after the short confirms ..

>have confirmed what they ask for to validate your account/ID
>still system errors on circle end
>same thing happen with coinbase
>now coinbase is working well for me

closed my circle accounts yesterday, IF you are able to buy coins it is likely then your account gets 'froze' for 3-5 'business days' (which was weeks for me) and you CANNOT move coin out of their wallet.

odd flop of services.. any relevance ? Just find it interesting some will have issues with one, or no problem, or be hit with a problem over the last x amount of months

13 Blocks to Bitcoin Dominance

Our key conclusions are that; 1) bitcoin is likely to remain a niche payment network and unlikely to gain mainstream adoption, and 2) we see little scope for blockchain technology to disrupt the back-end architecture given that card acceptance already takes place instantly and card schemes provide invaluable dispute management which is difficult for a new technology to disintermediate.

...note eight key challenges that have the potential to limit the utility, and therefore reduce adoption, of blockchain systems.

Security vs Cost trade off: The security of the bitcoin blockchain is ensured by syntactic rules and computational barriers to mining. Permissioned architectures are cheaper to run, but as we increase our trust in permissioned authors, we lose the distribution which is a guarantee of ledger integrity

The Euro experiment has failed.  Youth unemployment in Greece is over 50%.  Italy's banks have just received another bail out - NOTHING SINCE 2009 HAS CHANGED.  Deutsch Bank and their derivative balance sheet is ridiculous enough to make Gods cry.  There is absolutely no sane person that could look at that and think there isn't a problem about to explode.  

French elections come early in the year, 'populist' parties are on the rise. 

Merkel has ruined not only German through her immigration policies but the rest of Europe through its monetary policies. Talk of 10 years lost growth in Italy and Greece, why are they going to just sit there for those 10 and say 'this is fine'????   

We (the U.K.) have thankfully left the sinking ship, once we trigger article 50 and start getting some favourable trade deals the smart countries will start to ask themselves what the great dream and the one currency is doing for them. 

I would (and relatively am in trading terms) betting my left testicle on the Euro as a currency not being around in 10 years time. 


As for the ETF, if, and that's still a big if ((however Trumps cabinet seem both favourable to Bitcoin and are technologically savvy(most important thing here)) then institutional investors and old ladies who can't even internet can invest, risk free into Bitcoin. 

It will be the biggest moment in Bitcoins (short) history if it is approved, and because we are dealing with an asset that can't be printed at whim or constructed on demand, the higher the demand the higher the price.

In my opinion, the 2017 Italian banking crisis will pass quietly, it will be a case of lend and extend.
I think most of us believe there is a huge world debt crisis coming but it may be a bigger event like Deutsche Bank crash, Stock market crash, housing market crash that  that causes it. 
During that big crisis it will not be bank bailouts but bail-ins where they take depositors money and we get cash withdrawal limits to keep the system going -that's when we all assume Bitcoin will see colossal gains. So long term I think yes Bitcoin is a good investment at that price but you would may to be patient (years).

""Or are we still anticipating a January correction once speculators go?""
With the current financial system mess with no real price discovery mechanism - who knows what the correct price of Bitcoins are? I recommend you average in and buy a set amount of Bitcoins every month so you are not too exposed to price swings.

Either way it'll hurt the Euro (which will actually help the European economy briefly). I watch these banks and many other financial products that are related to these banks. I can tell you that the banks will be bailed out and it'll hurt the Euro. And I feel it'll happen in 2017 (but it could be delayed with ""massive infrastructure spending""). Yeah..bitcoin will go up. In January? That one I don't know. Maybe. Will it be up by the end of 2017? Yeah. Almost certainly. Will it be because of the Italian banking crisis? Sort of....plus all the other financial engineering projects that are currently unwinding.

The ETF...it won't get approved. Why would our government allow this to get approved? I mean...seriously. Bitcoin is mostly used for buying drugs, illegally transferring money, or doing illegal shit. So...no...it won't be approved. I am not trying to be a dick or trying to be funny. I am just telling you that this is the CURRENT main use of bitcoin (other than holding or trading as an investment...but is that really a ""use""?).

If the ETF were to be approved then bitcoin would go up a LOT. I am a mediocre mathematician (by trade). My estimate is that bitcoin will quickly go to about $4,000 if the ETF is approved. And yes, it will become a gold rival. But I have no idea how much this will affect the overall gold market since that market is HIGHLY manipulated and is now mostly based on complex derivatives.

The ""underlying asset"" (aka BITCOIN) cannot be traded with a ""high frequency."" That is true. But that just affects its volatility usually. It can still be traded in large quantities, so large orders can go through. And those large orders can go through more quickly if they decide to pay a fee to expedite it. So...I wouldn't worry about any of that. Plus, the exchange spot price is very accurate and the ETF will just mirror this. Basically, if the SEC is not controlled by whomever it is that is keeping a regulatory hand on bitcoin, then it'll be approved. But...it won't be approved, don't worry.

For the record: I want it to be approved. Also, it would be a feedback loop for a while. It would be SO crazy the first few days after it opened. Just....imagine....",1,0,1483223782.0
10,"> how can they tie it to transactions based on the price/demand when the underlying asset is so difficult to buy and sell in high frequency 

Here's a general overview ho ETFs work:

https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-etf-files/toy/

So the ETF doesn't have to grow (or shrink) based on demand.   If the BTC/USD exchange rate goes up, investors bid higher for the ETF.     Arbitrage might happen if the ETF gets out of whack with the underlying exchange rate.  If the ETF is more expensive than the underlying Bitcoin, a trader can perform arbitrage without changing exposure to Bitcoin by selling their ETF share (for fiat) and using that to buy the underlying BTC that the ETF share represented. 

This, in theory, should cause the price of the ETF to not differ widely from the value of the underlying asset.

For various reasons the $GBTC ETF trades well above the underlying commodity ... more than 20% currently: http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GBTC/quote 

That's primarily because demand for a Bitcoin ETF is high and $GBTC is not issuing new shares of the $ETF -- thus the only seller are those who previously had acquired shares.

Most ETF managers try to have the share price approximate the value of the underlying commodity.  If there were more Bitcoin ETFs, the premium on this one would likely shrink significantly.

And anyway, as to your concern about the underlying asset ""being difficulty to buy and sell"", there are a number of OTC traders, or Gemini auctions, etc., -- institutions have a number of methods in which they can buy and sell, in additional to the retail exchanges you and I are familiar with.",1,0,1483226357.0

14,">but if Italy's banking crisis hits in 2017, won't this cause the Euro to take a relatively big hit? 

If I remember correctly Grexit fears didn't have the impact people thought they would. Unlike the Chinese, European citizens have a lot of places where they can park their money so they don't seem as interested in bitcoin as a safe haven asset. 

IMO China is all that matters when it comes to the bitcoin price.

Secondly, how will the ETF work? If approved, this could really help BTC become a gold rival for commodity traders. I mean, how can they tie it to transactions based on the price/demand when the underlying asset is so difficult to buy and sell in high frequency given the nature of the technology

A 91 year old woman in Kristianstad may not redeem the 108,000 she saved. The bank refused to accept the notes, because the woman could not explain where they came from. Now give the administration the right bank the right.
The woman saved the first money in the drawer, because she did not trust banks. Then in a safety deposit box.

The bills, however, had gone out, and when the woman turned 90, she wanted to redeem them to live a little more luxurious retirement.

But because the woman had no proof of where they came from, the bank refused to receive notes with reference to the Riksbank's regulations.

The woman appealed
The woman appealed to the Administrative Court. She writes that she is not a criminal and not present a criminal record. She has lived efficient and economical, and now wanted to splurge a little during his last years of life.

The woman wrote that she sold the car, gold, jewelry and clothing. At first she thought the money for a trip, but when that did not happen, the money was lying in the drawer and later in banking union.

According to the Riksbank needs a person not to have been convicted of a crime for redemption of banknotes to be denied.

So how do you make sure Amanda's check doesn't bounce? Same rules apply, staple an old check to Amanda's check. And you repeat this thought process over and over until you reach the Mint.

Of course, at some point the binder of checks becomes too big to realistically carry or verify. But what if the whole process was digital? You still have the same security, but without all the dead trees. Enter Bitcoin's Blockchain tech.

See, most banks treat your balance as a transaction sheet as a generic in and generic out, not Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, I'm not just sending you some generic amount of 5 mBTC, I'm sending you, specifically, the 2.5 mBTC I got as change from the coffee shop down the road, plus the 1.5 mBTC that I got as a tip on my Twitch stream using Coinstream,  plus the 1 mBTC that's leftover from the last time I converted from fiat on LocalBitcoins.

I feel like it's sloppy, and could be refined, but that's what I got.

Illustrations of the blockchain and how it accounts for/keeps records of all transactions publicly and why this is beneficial to all users of bitcoin would be the most helpful, at least to folks like me who are still learning this technology.

11,"Hey, /u/404llc
I have lot of crtics for you. You need to bare the words here. No other go. You website is not that good enough.

I give a score of only 40 out of 100. Here I will say why? Read all. If you read and comment back on these lines, I would be glad that I did really help a real guy.  

You need SSL Certification
People may find a link route to intrude into exchange sites from where you seek trades. Leads to vulnerabilities.

The design is completely awkward for me. Redesign it.

Select a perfect theme. The social media buttons are located in the places where people won't go for a share.


There are three charts ""Last 24 hours BTC/USD price"". But all three are same. It seems the website is in works.
When I click ""Last 24 hours BTC/USD price"" It is not taking me to bitcoinity.org. Why? Fix it as quick as you can.

The language option button must be place to the top right of the webpage. It is in the wrong place. I first thought it will redefine the chart to a particular language speaking people and show only btc transactions happening there. Change it.


""Why are you waiting for first trade to occur?"" I think unfare for the reason you run this site. Transactions happening round the clock. So change it. Show transactions of all time. Also the wait period for first trade takes around 5 minutes to start. People will leave your site if it is the case. Here you can go for options - All time trade, New trades. This will help.

Fatal error :

When I refresh the page, the page again looks for first trade. This should be fixed. It should not be so. Again go for new trades/all time trades.

Your twitter feeds must be shown on the right side. This is very handy for people to read. Left side attracts less.
The social media icons on the botton of the page is very small and will not be visible to many people. It sucks.

The exchanges you listed to the bottom of the page ""Data from ..."" is completely not visible. You don't need to gray it. You should be proud to list it. Increase the size. It is very small. This applies to next line also. Also ask people to suggest sites and currencies to add. 

If it is opensource developement, then where do you host or update your code. Include github or other similar site where you host your code. That will please people.

The advertisement placements are ok. But it is not visible or don't get you clicks. You need to work on it.

When I click one of the news links, it takes me to a new page and then redirects to the website where the content page is located.

But when it takes to the next page, I see the fiatleak redirect link with some random hash. Instead, you can modify the redirect link with actual news information. If you know wordpress, you can know how can you change this. It is one of the important thing every blog creater uses.

Alternately, you can create a blog.fiatleak subdomain. Curate news content to your blog. Show the startup lines and add ""Read more..."" button and when people click ""Read more..."" redirect them to the concernced website. 

When I click on the exchanges you list, it opens the exchange site on the same tab. Instead code it to open a new tab. 
You have included these exchanges in your calculations. BITSTAMP, BTCChina, BTC-E, Bit2c, Mercado Bitcoin BR, Local Bitcoins, OKCoin, BTCTrade, Huobi China, bitx.co.za, Cavirtex, Bitfinex, Gemini.

I thought when clicking one of the sites, you will be redefining the animations particular to that exchange only. Misleading.

There are lot of excellent themes available on the internet. One of the best one is bootstrap which I admire a lot. Create your website using any of the themes. You first need to try different themes. You can conduct a poll from your supporters to select a good theme. 

I think you're the only one who takes care of back and front end. That's why the designs are not appealing. I don't think this website loads well in mobile phones.

Did you check the loading time of the website? Did you check with different browsers? Do you have the analysis? How much you're comfortable with CSS? 

I think you're using apis of concerned websites to fetch data and do your math. Do you know the api limits of these sites? You need to catch exceptions wherever possible. I think if 100s of viewers online, you may see delays in fetching and displaying. Look into it.


Why you need ""Hide animations?"" button. I don't see a need of this website, if you hide animations. The worst thing is the moment you tick ""Hide animations"" the incoming trades are not shown. I check 2 to 3 times. No trades coming in after I click it. But it is working. It seems you need to ""QC"" with different use cases. Also you need to check for the 1m trade volume. It seems not calculating correctly. Or the animations are not understandable by all.

If you turn off the animation, then you need to add more text to textually visualize the btc-currency pair transaction. Example ""USD to BTC"" ""BTC to CNY"" for every trade that happens. You need also add these to the leftside textbox which displays every trade you track.

Why you need this website? How can it help the new comer to bitcoin? How can people know about fiatleak? Who will introduce fiatleak to new comers? and many questions you need to answer yourself.

There is no coinmarketcap information in any place. 

You need to add options to show/hide sections of the page. User must be able to show/hide twitter feeds, leftside trade display box. News section, that bitcoinity.org chart section. Why the chart is not updating?

Besides, you can include lot of information. This is a very simple one. If you target Adsense you need to work a lot on keywords and techniques to make it search friendly.

How many times in a week, you analyze your traffic? That is needed.

I did a small analysis on the technologies you use in building the website. I have seen nginx and some other good stuff there. But you need a lot of improvement. You have excellent set of tools to help you there. But you're delaying.

Some other tips

1. Don't use iframes. It is not used in these modern days. Not worth to use it.

2. fiatleak.com -watch... heading tag must be smarter than that is now and should be shorter than 80 characters.

3. Meta description should also be rephrased to be smart and simple and easy to understand.

4. Add alt tags to images you include.

5. No social share so far. Don't you even share it in your site. Or my analytics didn't show much.

6. You have very few backlinks. Try to increase it.

7. Keyword usage is very low.

8. You need to add more content pages for your site. There is 0 or no content page available right now for your site. If you add content pages, you can get more keywords and get listed in search engines faster.

9. Page level speed is very poor. You're making as hard as 81 requests to show this page. Work on it. This is not helpful in the long time. You can use bitcoinwisdom.com like sites to fetch trade information by one request instead of sending request to all exchanges.
Alternately, you can make a local database that collects data from all exchanges and use a single query to fetch from there. This increases speed to a great level. 

10. You must be aware of loading javascript at the bottom of the page to speed up the page load.

11. I think you have CSS in a stylesheet. Good. But still you need to work on. Use Minfication techniques if not done.

12. Try to use gzip, Etags. Session cache also helps to retain the animations when people refresh the page.

Okay. My Best Wishes.

12,"To be honest, what most people first ask is ""What will I gain?"" 
I think a vid/ picture depiction of btc's rise in value + the borderless nature of its transactions is what can convince people. 
Being able to send funds anywhere in the world without any form of restriction is a big plus for btc.
Most wont really want to delve into anonymity at first, but the idea of money that can be hidden is appealing.
Also i think the blockchain technology is greatly underlooked. People need to see the potential in a decentralised open ledger system

**First :**

I wish you great success with fiatleak. I believe you have come in a right place for perfect brainstorming.

I already have seen some great suggestions from a lot of people above. 

I don't know much about bitcoin. I'm still a fresh learner everyday. 

However, I asked a question to me ""What should I need from fiatleak if I'm a user, developer, investor, trader, firm?"" and interpreted myself to come with some points.

This is a very short list. I need to say something more if I get enough help.

Excuse me, if I have written something you already have, or suggestions from people posted above and below. 

I might add/edit the post if I strike a new point or express a listed point in more clear way. 

I don't know if my points are worth to read and reward according to your brainstorming needs. However, I expressed myself.

Finally I wish a great prosperous new year wishes. Thanks. Moving into discussions now :

**Basic information**

What should you know? Explain to just a user, a developer, an investor, a company, alien levels.

**Wiki**

Wiki must include basic information about bitcoin. History of bitcoin, recent developments, criticisms, controversies and different testing implementations and the adapted techniques one by one. You can easily link to existing wiki. However, a fiatleak wiki in a much approached way to target the visitor can attract more people and works well overtime. 

You need to update it often as things are changing rapidly. You can also host debates,AMAs and ask people to post their questions, suggestions. You can also try to answer the questions. This will get you return visitors. 

**Honor your visitors**

Illustrations, Wiki are not quite enough. After every page/topic/tutorial/video/illustration/visual/debate/AMA/etc., you can host a quiz and reward people.

You can reward users in different means :

* Award currency - bitcoin, any altcoin, Fiatleak altcoin (if you wish to create).

* Badges - Award bitcoin badges who pass quizzes. As you know, you can fix the level a beginner/expert/developer/pro. You can also let him/her link a fiatleak badge to his/her blog or affix in his/her firm.

* Certification - You can turn into a training institute and start certifying people by treating your quizzes are real tests. You can also earn great reputation in the marketplace. If you're intended to so, this will be a lot of work for you and you need to include programming resources for bitcoin.

* From time to time and on special days/occasions you can host mega contests, get sponsors and award visitors. It can get your site keep visited. I don't intend it for marketing and your growth. You need to do it wisely by not making people mistakenly think about a lottery site. You can award Hardware wallets, Desktops/Laptops, Mining hashes, Free courses, tickets to next to happen tech thans/stalls/etc., 

[Note: You can also get sponsors for quizzes. Let them award people]

**Physical bitcoins** - What is it? Who is making? Can you make one? How it can be traded? + information

**Plus** 

* Videos, pdfs, handouts, Memes, cartoons will help new people who learn things differently.

* Ask visitors **""Can you live with bitcoin?""** Then take them to virtual home/office/marketplace and visually illustrate how can they live with bitcoin. Let them visually and virtually (really also) make purchases, spendings, book orders, reserve suits, lease, start a firm, pay employees, tip people, pay taxes and else in bitcoin. 

* This includes selling for bitcoin, spending for bitcoin, working for bitcoin and many more. You need to brainstorm for a lot of time to get a clear script of what you're going to say here. 

* Virtual tour helps people realize bitcoin usage and a vital addition to fiatleak.

[Note : Source real offers from merchants and let people use in realtime inside visuals. You can also let people use coupons. A great marketplace ahead. Brainstorming will unveil more. I will put a ... here]

* You can try to get great artworks, animations+sounds to show the walk of the life. While illustrating these things, you can include references to live websites, merchants and other setups to make the visitor feel the reality. 

[Note: You can also charge PPM, PPC from them as you're practically advertising while visually preparing newcomers to adapt to bitcoin.]

* You can also ask the people/visitor to post their own views/artworks/visuals/illustrations/blogs that leads to basic understanding, usage and implications of bitcoin at various levels. 

[Note : An SEO healthy link from their own blogs can get you load of visitors daily and make fiatleak one of the imminent website to source information about bitcoin. Long way to go]


**Fiatleak Platform**

**[The fiatleak website/platform must be view complaint on all platforms existing. Desktop, Tabs, Mobiles etc.,]**

Create a fiatleak platform exclusive for your visitors to explore all the possibilities in one screen. 

The platform must be a fully complied great source of information for bitcoiners.

Help people to get tickers, live update links, other stuff that they can stick to their website.

Make fiatleak platform as most advanced information provider in terms bitcoin transactions.

You may include :

>Currency wise transactions

>Country wise transactions

>Minute, hour, day, week, year transactions

>Volume based transactions

>Year, Week, Month, Volume based, Country based, currency based comparisons

>Insustry wise break down analysis of support, adaption, volume, company, freelancers, regulators, taxmen, etc., 

Let users to customize the listings, so that he can visualize according to his/her mind needs. You need to consider a forex professional's point of view.

[Note : Upon success, extend the same to all altcoins that you wish to include]

**Price charts**

I think this is simple. Include price charts similar to trendingview and let people to work on it if they wish to find out trading stuff. This would turn fiatleak into a great platform.

**Calculators/Estimators**

Include calculators. This will help viewers to estimate their profit/loss or make decisions about their next moves. These calculators must also include mining, trading, lending, forex calcs if needed.

Public spending price alerts [I think some users may have suggested it.]

A robust update 24x7 in a page/link that helps users to know about bitcoin support providers in terms of :

>Payment Gateways

>Websites

>Merchants

>ATMs

>Debitcards

>Developers

>Startups

>Freenlance Reources

>etc.,

[Note : I wish to have a detailed customizable list based on countrywise, statewise, popularity, Newly included and many other criteria]

**Regulatory/Banking rules for all countries**

Prepare a great list of information about laws and regulations in each country and add it to fiatleak. Let the users customize and view the regulations and rules they have to follow for their country.

**Tax Implications**

List tax implications for all countries

[Note : Here you can seek country wise law, taxmen to get information to list in the concerned country pages. You can turn into a great law, taxmen board to interact with their country men to deal bitcoins. This will help people who startup a crypto firm, project or wish to do business.

Make it customizable.

Host AMAs, run request campaign for regulators if people need it. Lot can be done. Brainstorm helps.]


**Customizable Richlists**

Let the user set his/her own criteria. Countrywise richlist of bitcoin holders on a particular year, date, month. Currency wise richlist of bitcoin holders + some other criteria. etc., etc., and etc., 


**Fiatleak API**

Help visitors get use of fiatleak platform and other stuff programmatically by creating compelling API that supports integration a variety of levels. This includes simply linking to their blogs/websites, business analytics. 

Help online tutors and presenters to quote live information from fiatleak. 

Create other stuff that can show dynamic live information.

**Fiatleak Forum** - Create a fiatleak forum that helps users interact.

**Blockexplorer** - Create most advanced blockexplorer and include information that most others don't have.

**A live chat** - A live chat window can help people seek support and contact with the administrators instantly.

**Support** Let people to reach you at any time. [Use social media effectively - email, slack, facebook, twitter, +]

**FAQ** - Frequently Asked Questions are must on all sections.

**Altcoin support** - Upon successful improvements for bitcoin stuff. Add altcoins one by one.


**Others**

How to add bitcoin support to your business?

How can you get involved in bitcoin mainstream support?

Challenges that bitcoin(ers) face in 2017.

Price speculation dicussion

**Fiatleak Cryptocurrency**

* Issue Fiatleak Altcoin and tip the visitors, shares your site. Good exposure for btc and good for fiatleak too.

* You can also issue fiatleak shares. Get Partner firms.

* Start a fiatleak bitcoin consultancy firm. Offer services such as Instant Merchant setup for online/offline merchants, etc.

* Establish Company setup advisory board to help bitcoiners.

* Setup Angel Investing Information/Consulting/Guidance panel and host campaigns like kickstarter+.

* Host Incubation Services

Read above as a snapshot. I hope this will offer enough directions for fiatleak. This is not the end. This is just the beginning. At least, one point or a part of a point may give you hint(s). I will try to add more points in time.

Thanks for reading. Good luck.

",-4,0,1483229472.0
5,"Idea is to reduce competition between large miners and small miners, creating two distinct mining communities, increasing mining decentralization.

1. There are two kinds of blocks. A-blocks and B-blocks. A-blocks are the same as what we have today. B-blocks have a non-outsourcable puzzle like the strategy described in [this paper](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/papers/nonoutsourceable.pdf). B-blocks cannot be pool mined.

2. B-blocks have a new POW. (e.g. SHA-3). This means that hardware for one type of block cannot produce the other type of block.

3. Blocks contain the hash of previous blocks according to this diagram: http://imgur.com/4apq2RC

4. Blocks on each phase can be produced every 10 minutes, resulting in a 5 minute block time overall.

5. Transactions are keyed according to which phase can mine them -- A-blocks can only contain A-transactions and B-blocks can only contain B-transactions. If an output is double spent by two transactions keyed to different phases, and both transactions are mined on consecutive blocks of different phases, then the version of the transaction included in the earlier block is valid and the other one is ignored. Since the mining fee on the second version of the transaction is invalid, miners have an incentive to avoid mining it. Another half-baked idea would be to make the mining fee come from a keyed output, so that the sender must pay a fee if their transaction is included twice...

The core idea I want to express is that all small miners who rely on pools will be forced onto phase A. Phase B will be entirely dominated by large solo miners. This creates an interesting type of diversity among miners based on the scale of the operation, which I have not seen described elsewhere. This could possibly result in small miners not being competed against as fiercely from solo mining operations, meaning the continued existence and significance of smaller miners is more assured. Large solo miners may be more susceptible to political pressure, so we don't want all of the blocks mined by them.

Interesting aspects of the phased block idea are discussed in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4gd5dv/phased_blocks_an_approach_to_increasing_the/)",19,1,1483215519.0

Coinciding with the volatile movement in the USD/NGN exchange rate in June, Nigerian interest in Bitcoin has been steadily growing. Google trend data suggests more people are inquiring about Bitcoin in Nigeria right now than the U.S. and Hong Kong combined during the 2013 price peak (link #1). LocalBitcoins indicates a growing number of Bitcoin sellers available to potential local buyers and with a population of 180 million people, over half of which use the internet, Bitcoin could see growing adoption if currency issues remain prevalent in the region. While Gross National Income per capita is low at $2,950USD, limiting the potential for a large influx of capital, Bitcoin adoption driven by human needs rather than an expected ROI is a welcome reinforcement to the cryptocurrency communities larger interests. It remains to be seen if Bitcoin can take hold as an enduring tool for the average Nigerian. 

As a side note I think it's unfortunate we don't have a more in depth perspective from Bitcoin users or new adopters in regions with expanding interests. Polling newcomers in Bitcoin related subreddits regarding their country of origin and the incentives that are driving them to seek out Bitcoin could be really valuable in understanding how Bitcoin as a whole is evolving.

28. We are in lack of payment processers/payment gateways for the masses, though there are many available.

29. Many people look for upvotes/promotions/community attention/exposure all over the space by rewarding people in the same thread or from another forum. Right?

30. People always have controversial to each other in r/bitcoin and r/btc channels. Their own standings change often.

And to those who think any sort of compromise is bad:

 * Many Core devs have already expressed their support for an eventual block size increase beyond Segwit. So why not do it **now** if this means ending the civil war?
 * Plenty of miners think they'll make more money in the long term with larger block sizes. We should take their view into account, because after all they are the ones securing the network.
 * This compromise is heavily biased towards the Core side anyway. Think about it: the block size increase is very modest, and buys us time for 2nd layer solutions to deploy and mature. Once those are in widespread usage, the clamour for larger blocks will die.
 * There's a good chance that without some sort of compromise we'll have a contentious hardfork. How is that better than a consensual hardfork?

Also, doing a 2mb Segwit SF AND and additional 2 MB SF is probably easier to get past the community.  I am not sure if the other side is ever going to allow a HF.

There is a lot of support for a small hardfork capacity increase in addition to segwit.

A compromise segwit+2mb proposal was submitted yesterday: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013921.html

We are all aware that segwit is eventually a capacity increase to perhaps 2mb. But it's not the same as a hardfork capacity increase compatible with the current transaction format.

I would also vouch for an additional capacity increase to 2mb on the main chain, so we can relieve the fee pressure, allow smaller outputs to be spent, then scale to 4mb with segwit.

There is no perfect solution, a compromise needs to be accepted to make peace and avoid a contentious BU, BIP148 or PoW fork.",1,0,1491033304.0

We are hoping to have a UK bank account to remit GBP from in the next 3-4 months. In the meantime, what I have done is to open an EUR account. You can do that quickly using one of the new challenger banks. Try DiPocket as an example. Verify that EUR account on Coinbase and withdraw funds to it in EUR.

1,"I liked this show.  This was the episode where I [accepted](https://twitter.com/deery_me/status/833567664652111873) my moniker.  

I was a bit surprised myself by Roger's statement while we were recording the episode.  His thinking is far too narrow.  Governments will eventually be competing with each other over control of Bitcoin network policy.  They will defend their interests, violently if necessary. This is where bitcoin is headed if we are successful.

The world is getting fed up with [legacy systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_Electronic_Registration_Systems), and large fractions of the world economies' backend systems will be secured directly or indirectly by Bitcoin [hashpower](https://medium.com/@BrianDeery/hashpower-is-the-ends-bitcoin-is-the-means-4de61c559bc0).  The hashpower is historically what has been touted as giving Bitcoin it's security, as a differentiator from other systems.  The hashpower is a lot of what the world wants.  Most industries will be touched by Bitcoin in one way or another.  It is way more than a payment system, as many on both sides of the argument seem to be limiting Bitcoin to.

With this context in mind, I am disappointed that some core devs seem [blind](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/62k567/nicolas_dorier_core_has_no_center_because/dfob2yb/?context=3) to the fact they are now politicians in one of the branches of Bitcoin governance.  By focusing inward, on technical matters while eschewing concerns of their constituents is poor politics.  The concerns may be baseless, and better solved through existing proposals, but this is a fight over governance, and the battle is being lost.

The miners must not be the ones to dictate which is the default client, as the branches of governance must be separate, otherwise powerful interest groups will weaken the basic tenets of Bitcoin.

At my weekly Bitcoin meetup a few days ago, the tension was palpable.  People are afraid.  This is in contrast to the preceding year, where it has been more of an academic discussion.  The questions and discussion revolved much more about what to expect in a contentious hard fork.  Core developers do not seem to be feeling this tension.

The [hashpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1SHF3YPrjM) is one of the largest factors of what makes Bitcoin valuable.  A change of PoW will be a concession of defeat.  Ethereum's main perceived value is the brains behind the project.  That is why most of the community followed the Foundation down their fork.  The brains behind Bitcoin are most certainly valuable, but the Bitcoin hashpower is comparatively more valuable than the Ethereum hashpower.  The outcome of a contentious Bitcoin fork following the existing devs is not as certain as it was with Ethereum.

I really hope the Core developers realize they are now politicians, and start acting like it.  A compromise would go a long way to easing the tension, even if it makes no sense technically.

0,"The deceased don't pay inheritance tax, their beneficiaries do. So I assume what you're really asking is: 'How can *I* use bitcoin to avoid inheritance tax?' 

As far as avoidance goes (legal attempts to reduce tax exposure) then bitcoin has no advantage over fiat. It's only useful if you wish to evade tax, i.e. illegally.

Although I agree with comments above about taxation as theft it's also important to respect the rule of law so I suggest dropping the idea. Use every legal trick in the book by all means, but don't actually break the law.

For an example, let's say granny buys a load of bitcoin as an 'investment' on the advice of her kindly grandson. Then, sadly, she passes, and it appears she didn't think to include the private keys in her will. The money is presumed lost. However, sneaky grandson has a personal backup of the keys and has full access to the funds.

This is seriously criminal behaviour, you are stealing from the government and also any other potential beneficiaries. I suspect it's jailable should you be caught and any purchased coins would be easily traceable. If they were ever moved it would be immediately obvious someone had the keys. Might you get away with it? Quite possibly, although either you've conspired with other beneficiaries or you've stolen from them too, which makes it more likely you'd get caught.

Tax sucks, it's way too high and we should all campaign towards a smaller state and use every legal means at our disposal to reduce our personal exposure. But don't break the law. It penalises other tax payers and puts you at serious risk.

Well, if gran decided to buy bitcoin off-exchange through Local Bitcoin or even through an exchange but somehow the coins were not recoverable upon her death... well there's nothing anyone could ever do about that.

See gran will need to make a backup of her keys, and its entirely reasonable for her to ask her tech savvy grand kids to help her. It would be their responsibility to make sure proper backups are made - but hey mistakes are made all of the time. But if those kids were lying the gang would consider it a serious insult and they're likely to send thugs armed with guns to punish the grand kids. 

The gang may ask to know things - like the address of the coins. Which they could get if they were able to coerce the exchange where gran bought her coins - but localbitcoins this is not necessarily true.

21,"Tl;Dr - Just skip to the bottom where I lay out my solar/battery requirements for mining and my solar/battery requirements for vertical farming. Oh...and costs and earnings.

Well, Summer is here and we have had some extremely hot weeks. This has given us a chance to test our greenhouses at temperatures of 126F/52C. We are still up and running quite well. Our energy requirements have gone up quite a bit. But the electricity we are consuming is right in line with our estimates. We do not feel that the temperatures will be any higher than the numbers we have seen so far. Unless Global Warming is for real...because now that I think about it, we did blow through our all-time-high in temperatures...and this was the last day of Spring, if I recall.

We are ordering all of our equipment directly from China. Our 40' greenhouses are extremely cheap to build in China. We are building them for about 40% of what companies like Freight Farms and Bright-Agro-Tech are selling their systems for. Our system is at least 90% as good as their systems. But we do have many bugs, it seems when we first receive them from China. Perhaps my main complaint. They can be a bit finicky. I would not want to sell these as the customer service would consume me.

Our most simple greenhouse uses between 250 and 450 kwh per day. I am in San Diego. Our residential rates from SDG&E are $0.43 per kwh. That is crazy high, for the record. This would cost between about $105 and $190 per DAY. Between about $3,000 and $5,500 per month. Most people in the US pay about $0.11 per kwh. This would equate to a monthly bill of $750 and $1350 per month. The Arizona desert pays that rate, for example.

Next, these greenhouses grow about 4,000 heads of lettuce per month. Wholesale price for this lettuce is $1. We sell direct to the end user. We charge $1.50. But at wholesale prices, this generates $4,000 per month in revenue. Labor is 10 hours per greenhouse. We pay $20 per hour. When you add all the California bullshit taxes and fees for employees this puts us at about $30 per hour. We also have insurance and Workers Comp. This is about $40 per month for each greenhouse.

Ok, now for the solar and battery requirements. We use 150 panels of 300 watt panels. I know...this is a lot. It takes a lot of space. You need a lot of cheap land. We spend about $0.45 per watt for solar panels from China. Our lettuce greenhouses run for 8 hours per day with lights. The other 16 hours we go ""dark"" and do not use much energy (just pumps, air conditioning and a few devices). We run the lights and everything during the peak sun hours. This allows us to not purchase as many batteries because we are turning the sun directly into the farming and lighting. Then, when the sun starts to wane, we turn most systems off and just remain in a well-insulated state. The battery requirements are still large, however. We currently use 50 lead acid batteries for each greenhouse. Each battery is 24V and 200 amp hours. Each battery costs us $180 from China.

Ok, how does this all tie into bitcoin and bitcoin mining? Here's the answer. Each Antminer S9 uses about 1400 watts when it is placed in the environment of our lettuce greenhouse. We place between one and four miners in each greenhouse. We need about 6,000 watts in solar panels to charge up the batteries and simultaneously run one S9 for 24 hours straight. We need 15 of the 24V/200 amp hour batteries for each miner. Cost for panels is $3,000. Batteries are $2750. The miner, when you buy from Bitmain is $1225 delivered to your door in the US. I have over-clocked the miners as high as I am comfy with. I am generating 0.007 btc per miner per day right now. That is about $18 per day at today's rate.

So here is how it all breaks down for the vertical farm: cost for one lettuce farm that is 100% off grid is about $90k. This includes EVERYTHING... solar, batteries, control systems, installation and framing for the solar, greenhouse, all equipment, air conditioners a water cooler...everything. Monthly labor, insurance, nutrients and supplies is $1500. Shipping of the lettuce is about $400. Total net profit is about $2100 per month. And $25,000 per year.

Mining...ok...this is the wobbly one to predict. Just remember this and it'll make it all easier to accept these numbers: bitcoin is probably headed to $10,000 within 3 years. If you don't believe that then much of this will just be comical to you (if it isn't already). One miner will cost (miner + solar panels + batteries + power control systems + cooling equipment and the solar/batteries to support it) = $8000. The solar and battery system costs a total of $6800. The miner is $1200. Once you have purchased the solar and batteries, you own them forever. They can be used to mine for 25 years for solar and at least 6 years with the lead acid batteries. You can amortize these costs.  If bitcoin drops to $0 then you can instantly switch your solar and batteries to your farm. This is how I backstop my potential losses. 

Now, here is the magical way we have figured out how to avoid the ""decay"" that is built into the miners: we run them for 4 to 8 weeks then we sell them on the open market at a premium over cost. When you purchase large numbers from Bitmain, they will offer you a discounted price. The miners seem to always go up in value in between releases fom Bitmain. After 6 to 9 months of reselling at this pace, you will make all of your initial investment back in the miners. You will also stay current with the miners. So, one miner will generate about 2 btc per year (when you stay ahead of decay). That is $5,000 per year at today's rate. If bitcoin follows the trend (and you believe) then I expect that you will generate $6500 or more within one year from mining today. This means the system will completely pay for itself (including solar and batteries) in about one year. Oh...and then after a year, you own a brand new miner (cuz you have been constantly reselling them to stay current and slightly profit). Oh...and you how have 6kw of solar AND batteries...just keep mining til bitcoin is outlawed. You are now in a unique position...your mining rig costs you $0 from this point forward.

I have calculated the amount of profit you can make if you build your own solar/battery array and point this array to different businesses. One business is a modern, vertical farm which is good for the environment and makes healthier food. The other is a bitcoin mining operation. Both businesses have energy as their single largest cost of doing business. I like the idea of having two businesses that I can just point an energy source towards and they start making money. Isn't that kinda cool to think about? Farming generates a net profit of $0.22 per kwh from a solar/battery system. Bitcoin mining generates $0.51 per kwh for the exact same system. Think about that for a minute.

Also, what the fuck? If bitcoin actually does take off, imagine how it will pollute the world with miners in places with shitty but cheap fossil fuel. Shouldn't we be mining on renewable energy since...let's be honest, bitcoin shouldn't really exist? It only exists because people lie a bunch. It seems like protecting ourselves from our despicable selves shouldn't turn the world into a toilet that may become uninhabitable.

I just wanted to share everything with this community. If it weren't for this community, I would have been nervous about trying this crazy idea. What I mean by this is that I appreciate the handful of people here who have a lot of bitcoin and just handed them over to me so that I could test this TOTALLY insane and HIGHLY SPECULATIVE business model. I told you (those who lost their btc to me) that I will make it up to you. For the couple of you who didn't threaten to kill me, I will return your btc when my profits from mining hit 4,000 btc, unless the price is under $3100 per btc...seems fair...you did lose...and it was a fair bet.

I hope for several things from this post. (1) The nice people who are here hopefully will take this info and appreciate what went into getting these numbers. (2) Someone will read this, run the numbers themselves and decide to do the exact same thing. (3) Someone in an area with good sun, year round, will set up a mining operation based on my model. (4) Someone will bet me publicly again that I am lying. (5) Someone interesting will buy the land next to mine and compete head-to-head with me...I seem to perform better under competition.

To;Dr - To take a miner off grid, in a sunny place, will cost $8,000 (including the miner). You'll break even in a year if you follow my plan (and if fate complies as well). One 40' greenhouse that is off grid costs me $90k. Least amount of net profit per greenhouse is $25,000 per year. Average net profit is $36,000per year, typically from blending lettuce and other crops such as basil.

Farming generates a net profit of $0.22 per kwh from a solar/battery system. Bitcoin mining generates $0.51 per kwh for the exact same system. Think about that for a minute. We sell energy back to the grid for about $0.05. Does anyone look at this the way I am looking at it?...I am just curious.

I can't find a way to get cash at the moment here. I'm just on a tourist visa at the moment, waiting for a better visa to be processed. When that finally gets processed I'll be allowed a local bank account, which means I can withdraw cash.

Cash is required for the transport system here. Unfortunately my debit card was eaten by the ATM the other day so I have to take cash out via a credit card. This is very expensive. Cash is so common here I'm having to pay through the nose while a new card arrives. I have to pay fees also for the debit card on cash anyway.

1) I contacted many used goods sellers asking if they would be happy to accept Bitcoin. They all refused. A shop selling used goods replied that they can accept a credit card... but they charge 3% for the privilege. 

2) In the population of 7 million here there is _1_ person selling cash in exchange for Bitcoin on Local Trader. That person is not replying to messages. 

3) Local Bitcoins has a few traders but all except one are wanting bank transfers. Banks will not take a customer here without a local ID card.

4) Even a few Taobao sellers in China have refused to accept Bitcoin. That might have been handy.

5) ANXBTC is based here but they are quite expensive for cash withdrawals and it will take a while to setup I'd imagine. 

 Any other ideas? I only need around 10,000HKD (1,000USD) to cover buying the things I can only really get with cash over the next (hopefully just) 2 or 3 weeks. 

In the end I think I'm going to have to just pay the fees. It totally sucks. There should be a card you can load with cash and then withdraw. I can only assume such a thing gets abused?

3,"**Why the Segwit2X hardfork will fail**

* For a hard fork in Bitcoin to succeed, **there needs to be near unanimous support from the entire Bitcoin ecosystem**, which generally includes the following constituent groups: node operators, users, core developers, wallets, exchanges, and miners.  Right now it's very clear that there is a large contingent of users, developers, wallets, and exchanges that have not signed on to this hardfork, so unanimous support is lacking.
* Even minor changes in Bitcoin (let alone critical consensus changes) have taken generally many months or years of review and testing by the best experts to ensure the code is safe and bug-free.  **The timeline for Segwit2X does not allow for the kind of testing and review needed**.
* The hard fork doesn't address the many concerns over the years that have been brought up about the negative impact of increased load, cost externalities, miner and node centralization, and potential consensus failures
* The timeline for the Segwit2X hardfork is such that there is no way for all the major groups to upgrade in time.  As [Greg Maxwell said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6h612o/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_core_wont_endorse/divtc93/): 

> ""Its time-frame is extremely absurd. Actually, absurd doesn't do it justice which is why between that and number #1 several engineers have been just responding ""LOL"" to the proposal. They don't set any time for design review and analysis, they don't set any time for writing a specification (they don't have one and don't appear to intend to have one), they set aside two weeks for testing-- which is less time than even minor releases of Bitcoin get (and need!) even when they were comprised of small fixes which had mostly existed for months already. They don't allot any time for alternative implementations to implement it (which is especially bad because they can provide useful design feedback). They don't set aside time for meaningful deployment by users (some of whom may have their own lengthy patching and qualification process). They don't seem to have any concern about how forced upgrades erode decentralization and privileged hosted wallets/apis/pools over running your own infrastructure. Basically every stage of the consensus rule change pipeline should take (and always has taken) more time they allotted for everything. BU+Classic BIP109 ran on testnet for months before their interoperability failure was revealed and they forked apart from each other and abandon BIP109.""


Now, let's assume for a moment that 80% of the hash power runs this fork as well as some of the economic ecosystem that signed the New York agreement like Abra, Bitpay, Coinbase, Blockchain, Purse, Shapeshift, Xapo, etc.  What would happen?  First, a large number of users and other parts of the ecosystem might not support it.  There are many economic parties that were not part of the agreement, such as wallets like Trezor, MyCellium, Armory, Bitcoin Wallet (Android), Green Address, Breadwallet, Electrum, etc.  There were a lot of exchanges that weren't part of the agreement, like Kraken, Poloniex, Bitstamp, Gemini, Bithumb, Bitfinex.  

What if several of those mentioned major economic players decide not to support Segwit2X and don't run the Segwit2X/btc1/NY client?  I believe what would happen in that scenario is the following:

* **Bitcoin will permanently hard fork into two chains** (note, this is not the oft-discussed chain split that could happen with BIP-148).  If the companies switching to the new chain insist on trying to call it ""Bitcoin"" instead of something else like ""Bitcoin2X"" then it would probably cause massive confusion in the ecosystem because everyone else still on the original chain would still call that chain ""Bitcoin"".
* Since the vast majority of core developers don't support this proposal, I believe after some possible period of confusion, eventually **everyone would converge back to calling the original chain Bitcoin since it's the chain that is supported by the Bitcoin Core ""reference client"" that is trusted by the majority of users today**.  The companies that signed the New York agreement would probably be forced to abandon trying to calling the new chain ""Bitcoin"" due to the confusion that would cause.  They would have to call the new chain something else like ""Bitcoin2X"".
* If there were two chains, many of the exchanges that were not party to the New York agreement, such as Kraken, Poloniex, Bitstamp, Gemini, Bithumb, Bitfinex, etc. just to name a few would probably list both coins at the least, or possibly just the original chain only.  That would also put pressure on the exchanges that signed the New York agreement to still provide users access to their coins on the original chain if there was a market for the original chain coins because to do otherwise could be seen by the users as a loss of economic value that they should be entitled to.  After the Ethereum hard fork, a few hosted wallet companies tried to ignore the fact that their users were entitled to coins from the original chain, but were eventually [forced to concede and give their users access to the coins](http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-enable-withdrawals-ethereum-classic/) on the original chain.
* Finally, I am speculating here, but I believe with both coins listed on various exchanges, **users would by a large majority choose to buy the original coin supported by the Bitcoin Core client**, NOT the coin supported by the Segwit2X/btc1/NY client.  Further, they would probably sell the Segwit2X/btc1/NY coins for core coins, forcing their price of Segwit2X/btc1/NY coins down significantly.  If the price of the original coin is higher and the Segwit2X/btc1/NY coin is lower, there would then be an enormous incentive for miners to abandon the new Segwit2X/btc1/NY fork and return to mining the original fork.  Even if the 80% of the mining hashpower that signed the New York agreement agreed to mine on the new chain, how long would they keep that up when they see they could make more money by switching back to the original Bitcoin chain being supported by higher prices and buy orders?  I posit that **so long as the users financially support the original chain supported by Bitcoin Core, the vast majority of miners will act in their own self interest and abandon the new Segwit2X/btc1/NY chain because it won't be as economically feasible to mine.**  Eventually, given that most developers won't support the Segwit2X/btc1/NY client, the coin will lose interest and possibly die off or remain a minor altcoin.

An important point to keep in mind is that nearly every core developer has at one point in time supported the idea of a hard fork and even larger blocks.  But what they *haven't* supported is doing it without a high degree of consensus on forking safely, without the best research, lots of testing, and a very long time horizon.  

If we truly want to hard fork Bitcoin, we need to do it wisely, following the very challenging but necessary process for making such critical consensus changes.  And it needs to be done with an open community process, not with a New York style agreement that leaves out major parts of the ecosystem.  Bitcoin core is not the enemy of hardforks, or even block size increases.  But **there has to be very good justification for making these changes, a high degree of consensus and buy-in from the whole ecosystem, lots of research, good code, lots of testing, and a compelling need.  It's a high bar, but not impossible**.  While there exists methods of getting more scale with safer methods (Schnorr signatures, bi-directional payment channels, transaction cut-through, extension blocks, lightning, flex caps, drivechains, etc.) hard forks seem less compelling for the moment.",11,1,1498819280.0

Coinbase use to pay the transaction fee for transferring bitcoin out of your Coinbase account, they no longer do that. Now, you have to pay the fee, and I believe they control what the fee is (It's been a long time since I transferred bitcoin out of Coinbase so I'm not sure of their protocol at the moment).

So, if you have 0.008 bitcoin in your wallet, and you want to transfer out 0.008 bitcoin, that leaves zero bitcoin left over to pay the miner's fee.

What you need to do is buy more bitcoin! Buy another $25, $50, $100, worth of bitcoin from Coinbase. Download and install **your own wallet on your own computer or phone**! Your Coinbase wallet should only be used to buy/sell bitcoin, not to hold bitcoin or make purchases. Use you own wallet to hold and spend, hold your own keys! If you don't hold the keys, you don't really own the bitcoin!

If you're installing a wallet on your computer, I recommend Electrum. **Very** flexible when it comes to the user picking the transaction fee.

If you're installing a wallet on your cell phone, I recommend Mycelium. **Somewhat** flexible when it comes to the user picking the transaction fee.

Now that you have your own wallet installed **and backed up**, transfer all bitcoins out of Coinbase into your wallet.

* On your computer wallet, go to the ""receive"" tab and click the ""copy address"" button. Then go to your Coinbase account and click ""send"". Paste the address into the send field. Then click ""use max"" to send the maximum amount after fees. And click ""send funds"" to send. Now you have all your bitcoins on your own wallet where you control the keys and the transaction fees.
* If you installed Mycelium on your phone, there's a little different process. You need to get a Mycelium address on your phone to your computer so you can paste it into the Coinbase webpage. Bring up your Mycelium wallet. Tap ""receive"". Tap ""copy to clipboard"". Go to texting and tap whatever icon you have to start a new text. For the receiving phone number, input your email address (**Yes, you can send a text to an email address.** Or if you have emailing on your phone past the address into a email and send it to yourself.) Now ""tap and hold"" where you would normally type a text until the word ""paste"" pops up. Let go, then tap ""paste"". Then tap ""send"". Now go to your email on your computer. You should have an email with the Mycelium address in it. Highlight the address and right-click the mouse and select ""copy"". Now go to your Coinbase account and follow the directions above (from the computer wallet section) to send the Coinbase bitcoins to your phone's Mycelium wallet.

And that's it. Now you have your own bitcoins, in your own wallet, holding your own keys, with a lot more control of the miner's fee.

If you want something with similar properties to Bitcoin but with very different workings, an IOU/barter network might work:

* I can issue an infinite number of theymos-coins.
* I only spend theymos-coins.
* I only accept theymos-coins in payment for goods/services.
* If I trust someone to provide value for their coins, then I can trade my theymos-coins for their coins at some exchange rate depending on how I perceive the relative difference in usefulness of the coins, and with a limit depending on my degree of trust in that person.
* If I want to pay some online shop who's never heard of me, it's done by routing through the trust network. Example: Bob deals with me from time and considers my coins to have value, so he's willing to trade 1 theymos-coin for 1 Bob-coin. Bob works for the online store, so the store will trade 1 Bob-coin for 20 Store-coins.

It's kind of a weird system to think about, and difficult to bootstrap, but if you got a whole community/city/country/world to use it, I think that it would work very well.

(You may notice that this similar to how Lightning is intended to work, though the idea predates Lightning by a very long time.)

If you're not allowed to use any cryptography at all, this system would I think still be possible, but it'd be a lot more time-consuming because you'd have to do a lot of face-to-face interactions.

3,"Want to share my personal experience:

Using two types of bitcoin storage - Trezor and Tails LIVE USB (with persistence).

FIrst was using Tails only (pretty secure), for diversification bought Trezor (now part of my btc stored on Trezor, another part on Tails).

I never (for 2+ years) got any problems even with high volume of btc. 

You need to undestarstand few simple rules:

1) NEVER use/recover/backup on a system that is directly connected to the Interrnet (or any online network) or in some way is connected/linked. btw, i am using Tails with connected WiFi trought  (so i can send coins). This way is not true for paranoid.

2) UNDERSTAND that absolutely every software may have bugs. Even Electrum or Mycelium, or Jaxx (had security hole few weeks ago, btw using all of these but not affected) or any ther software/hardware wallet. 

3) Not only software authors are responsible for bugs/holes, there always is possibility that compromised is your other software on same pc, operating system or even hardware (spy games). The main point is - less software you are using, more secure storage  it is (for this reason hardware wallets are most secure digital way to store coins, because there is minimalistic, task-focused low level code/functionality)

4) PAPER/steel wallet still is most secure way to store. DO NOT use/create paper wallet, if you aren't experienced IT-guy, because there are high risk to print it in insecure way. For best security you should to create it on a live system with hardened security settings and destroy your printer after printing paper wallet.

5) REMEMBER - virtual machine has same security level as your host machine. I don't recommend to use this option for storing coins. Maybe it is usefull in case of sending coins, using anonimized network connection or something similar. But not as coin storage.",2,0,1498945656.0
4,"Hokay. So.

I'm treating BTC as more of a long-term investment strategy than an active currency at this point. Thus, I'm really just hodling and don't really need portability or on-the-go transactions.  I'm basically just collecting BTC from a couple exchanges online with regularly-spaced purchases which I then transfer an Electrum wallet on my Mac. 

**I currently store said wallet (both the Electrum.app and all its contents/dependencies) in an AES-256 encrypted storage container I created with VeraCrypt for an additional layer of security.**

I've looked at paper wallets, but they're really unappealing to me.  I'd very much prefer a digital option.  After a good bit of reading, I decided a hardware wallet would be the way to go.  Unfortunately, it seems they're all sold out except for Trezor, which I can get mailed to me immediately, but at an added expense of about 50% - all in. That's an option I'm still considering, but a bit expensive for me; the Ledger Nano S was my first choice but they won't even be available to ship until September, which is too late. I'm trying to get this taken care of before the fork/segwit shit hits the fan.

Traditional cold storage (i.e. a separate, offline computer) is something I *technically* could do; I have an old Debian netbook, as well as a RaspberryPi laying around.  But doing so seems like a pretty big pain with a hefty amount of requisite research in order to get it properly setup.  Then there's the hassle of trying to securely move files between the two computers any time I need to sign a transaction.  

**So my questions boil down to:**

* Could a secure virtual machine (e.g. TAILS - which has an integrated Electrum Wallet) be used as cold storage?  I realize that the idea is that nothing on the cold-storage machine ever touches the internet, but what if I used VMware to sandbox the VM by disabling its network connectivity entirely and stored all of the VM disk images, files, etc. on an encrypted USB drive?  My thinking is that this would simplify signing transactions by making them doable on a single screen.  
* What if I just created a dedicated TAILS (or other live-bootable) image which I only used for BTC transfers - i.e. not technically a ""cold"" storage wallet, but rather a secure OS environment which is exclusively used for BTC transfers and is only active for a few minutes at a time?

**Would either of those net me any security benefit?**

In the entirely likely event that I come off as a bit of a n00b, it's because I am.  Advice, tips, and lessons are very much appreciated, but try to be constructive/helpful.  Please don't just say ""no"" and call me a moron or something.  I'm admittedly new, but I'm trying to learn here.  

Thanks in advance!

Thank you for reaching out!

BitPay observes the proof-of-work based consensus rules of Bitcoin and will follow the consensus changes that miners enact as long as we do not view those changes to be harmful to our users (in which case we would likely evaluate a potential transition to an alternative fork of Bitcoin in concert with others in the community).

Regarding the proposed segwit changes specifically, BitPay fully supports it and is working with miners to encourage activation as soon as possible.

Regarding BIP-148, we are not signaling or running it as it would put our users at risk.

One of the things that btc won't tell you is that many of its members, perhaps mods even are involved in the practices of scatology. This is a method by which you throw feces at a wall and interpret the patterns to divine the future, as well as for sexual gratification. 

My memory of the party is hazy but I do remember that at one point in the dim red light that Roger  Ver himself appeared in front of me after the events were already underway--attendees were giving each other enemas, splattering poop and poop-water all over the floor--and touched me on the shoulder. He said to me, ""mattisb, let me tell you of our plans to ruin bitcoin. But first, let us poop in each other's mouths."" He then squatted down and squeezed out a nasty poop, right into Dr. Craig S. Wright's eagerly awaiting mouth. 

Bitcoin Cash supporters are by and large poop fiends. This is satire, but given how they think, isn't it at least possible they're guilty of such acts or even worse? 

And that's why bitcoin cash really is a shitcoin.

11,"I have no idea if the following is true, but it is a plausible theory in my view (and a reason to sell BCH before it crashes):

The spam attacks which were the only reason the blocks were full were expensive for whoever was behind them, but that party had a plan - pump altcoins and fork/take over bitcoin.  

The altcoin pump was very effective.  When miners began to signal for Bitcoin Unlimited instead of segwit, bitcoin's ""dominance"" (its share of the total crypto market cap) fell from 85% to 50%.  

Part two of the plan went sideways when Bitcoin Unlimited proved unviable and the UASF movement demonstrated that SegWit would not be blocked.  

Whoever it was behind this attack then desperately pulled off the BCH fork on the day that the UASF was due to activate - thereby creating further confusion and adding to the altcoin pump.  

Greed and powerlust had those parties propping up the price of BCH with their gains from the altcoin pump, but they have spent themselves out and the price is slowly sliding relative to BTC. 

As the chain is practically abandoned (virtually no transactions) and miners keep leaving it due to the low price, there is no stability in its block discovery time and it is clearly becoming an abandoned shitcoin but with an absolutely stratospheric market cap.  A 90% decline relative to bitcoin is entirely possible over several crashes.  There are no fundamentals indicating it should increase in value relative to any of the top 10 coins in fact (and some of them are pure shit too).  

So sell that shit while there are still some funds supporting its value.

8,Superb and accurate storytelling.  ,-1,0,1506777228.0
9,"Here's broadly how Segwit2X came about, since so many are asking (if I mangled or missed something it's okay, my post is secured by proof-of-pedantry and you can find the proper info in the comments):

Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit).

This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.

He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself).

The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.

Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners).

Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.

With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named ""UASF"" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with ""Segwit2X"", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.

The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit.

To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:

Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.

All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.",116,1,1506739007.0

- prevailing consensus on r/bitcoin is that if exchanges offer both btc1x (probably called ""btc"") and btc2x, that btc will be priced much higher. There is no backup plan.
- prevailing NYA consensus is that >90% of the hash rate and therefore users will follow the 2x ""upgrade"" (probably called ""btc""), and there is no replay protection as a backup plan.

Result: if either side is right, bitcoin in one form or another lives on. If the reality, no matter what outcome anyone wants, is anything in between, it will be a big mess.

>I'm also trying to understand why 0-1mb increases in Bitcoin size was fine but 1mb+ is seen as unnecessary centralisation?

It isn't the increase in blocksize that people here are objecting with. I think you'll find the vast majority agree that at some point a block size increase will become necessary. I think that main issue many are objecting to is the back room nature of the deal made out of the light of public view, and the rushed, sloppy nature of the code being pushed out. It is tremendously immature and capricious to throw this huge change to bitcoin out so fast and without rigorous testing and criticism. Contentious hard forks MUST be avoided at all costs. 

Not only does this particular hard fork NOT try to avoid it, it actually *rushes* it out by means of a tiny, tiny dev team bereft of community and expert critic and review, and is funded by a cartel of Chinese miners and big companies with interest in co opting bitcoin to their corporate purpose. 

On a side note, you'll see that many subversive alt coin supporters such as yourself deeply support this break, as it tends to make their shitcoins look more appealing to casual passers by who know little to nothing about the big picture. GG",2,0,1506795309.0

What should you do with it and your BTC stake? It can only go up, down or nowhere (sideways).

What should you do with your cash and your stake based on what you think you should do in all three cases?

In other words if it can go up, what do you do (buy, hold or sell which stake, cash or BTC). Down, what do you do? Sideways, what do you do?

I taught myself this exercise for trading as a way to force my decisions

____________________________________

Here is how I approach that situation considering we now know that your investment returned to breakeven value:

Since the price has returned to its value this shows why these are good questions to ask yourself as a trader. This is about the psychology of trading and how your mind will play tricks on you based on fear, greed and emotion.

So the price is at $4300.

Let's say you had bought at $4300 and the price dropped to $3500. Do you buy, sell or hold?


If you say hold, then what you are really saying psychologically is that you don't believe the price will go down further. If you do think the price will go down further, then you should really sell and then determine if you want to buy in later at a lower price. That makes sense right?

So if you don't think the price will go down further and you want to hold, then what you are really saying is that the price will stay flat for a time or will go up again. If you honestly think the price will go flat for months or years, then you should sell and put that money to work someplace else. Otherwise, inflation will erode its value and you will lose potential gains somewhere else (otherwise known as opportunity cost)

If you think the price will return to its original value at $4300 where you will breakeven, then what you are really telling yourself, is that you should buy. Because, with a stake at $4300 and a stake at $3500, the value of the two back at $4300 will give you a gain over that time. Not only will you have lost nothing, you will have gained.

If you just wait for your stake to return to its original value, you would have lost time and money due to inflation

So to recap. 

If it goes down and you don't want to buy more because you think you can lose more, then you should sell your original stake. Most people will not do this. They are psychologically hardwired to not do this out of fear.

If you want to hold thinking it will stay there you should sell and invest somewhere else.

If you want to hold and wait for breakeven you should buy more. Your breakeven will be lower and your old breakeven will give you a gain. Most will also not do this also out of the control of fear

So if you had bought more when it dropped below $4000, you would be sitting on a nice gain as it is now at $4300.

So assuming you bought and are sitting on a gain, do you now sell, hold or buy more? :)

And thus the cycle starts again

So you see, being a trader is about asking yourself the right questions. Most people, when their stock drops ask themselves the wrong questions ",34,1,1506794867.0

Replay protection means that transactions made for one chain are incompatible with the forked chain.

One example of an address you don't control is the receiving address of an exchange offering to trade your Segwit2x coins for bitcoins. This is because the transaction made using the Segwit2x client would also be a perfectly valid transaction using the Bitcoin Core client. Any troublemaker could run both a Segwit2x full node and a Bitcoin Core full node and have a program copy transactions from the mempool of one node to the other. The exchange, if they were running both a Segwit2x full node AND a Bitcoin Core full node, and if their nodes used the same address pool (probable since the Segwit2x developer is mostly copying Bitcoin Core), they would see two transactions appear on both full nodes to addresses THEY control after you tried to send the unsplit Segwit2x coins.

There's a way to split the coins safely by simultaneously sending them to separate addresses you control. Electrum's developers published [instructions for doing this](http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/hardfork.html#what-does-it-mean-to-split-your-coins) using their software. In theory, though, I think you could use any wallet that can generate and store private keys (Bitcoin Core, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Armory, etc.). It's easier with wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF). If you fail to split the coins (both transactions are mined into a block on both chains immediately) then don't worry, there is no problem; you just sent your coins to yourself. Try splitting them again.",1,0,1506838733.0

3. Antminers have a [kill switch](http://www.antbleed.com). Get another brand or make sure to disable the kill switch.

5. During the chaotic first few weeks after the attack, mining for Bitcoin might be very profitable, but maybe not.

Although the exchange will stop all trading operations by September 31 2017, BTCC has stated that it will continue to process withdrawals until October 31 2017. The Chinese government’s decision to cease the operations of all cryptocurrency exchanges **except for Okcoin and Huobi** right before the nation’s virtual currency regulations are set to come into effect, has led to speculation that the surviving exchanges may be the only cryptocurrency exchanges permitted to operate in China moving forward.


Bobby Lee has always been a strong supporter of Core, decentralization and Segregated Witness.

Could it be that Bobby Lee was considering to withdraw from the NYA agreement and 2XCoin coming November? And the Chinese government that has control over Bitmain wanted to prevent BTCC from having any influence by possibly not listing 2XCoin?

Or is it just coincidence that all of this is happening right before the hard fork? And OKCoin and Huobi are allowed to continue doing business, while BTCC is not?

3,"Most have heard the rules. The longest valid chain with the most proof of work is Bitcoin. Or as some say the most proof of work. Or is it the chain with the most nodes. It's all confusing. But I'll explain from a human aspect on how we judge things. 

1. Bitcoin has evolved from a small tiny niche protocol. Along the way it has had many downfalls and many surprises. It never gives up. Hence the honey badger. But what gives it this characteristic. It's the drive and motivation of the people. Unbreakable spirits united to make it the best. 

2. Till the day arrived where more people joined. They want to join in making money too. As Bitcoin grows so does its complexities. People are very complex. But it's a gold rush. 

3. For years the debate of how to scale was an unforgiving battle. It's a mix of hardware, software, businesses, and investors. Each want has its own way of saying this is what we should do. In the beginning this was relied upon Core. They write the code that mostly everyone uses. Then other devs came in and created competition. But for the most part 90% of the community runs cores code. 

4. This brings us here today. A competing implement has arrived that has miner support and some business support. This is not to be taken lightly. The dev is addressing a need of the community under what the miners have demanded for 2 years. Core delivered Segwit. 

5. But none of this matters after Segwit is on the chain. Any blocksize increase doesn't matter. Segwit enables easier off chain scaling. It's called LN. Now the main chain companies that have sided with the miners must now realize this. You ran out of time to 2X. The battle to wrestle the code for your benefit is passed. Plus by holding the protocol hostage to demand a blocksize increase spoiled the milk. Users are not on your side. Throw as much money and salt as you want. Users will migrate to the path that leads to LN. 

6. November will come and the chains will split. The 1X chain will prevail. Why? Because LN devs work with Core on technical issues. They are creating a complement layer on top of the chain you so want to rule. These devs do not have to follow the longest chain or the most worked chain. Nothing binds them to Satoshi consensus. 

7. What will users do. They will migrate to wallets that allow them to have segwit transactions first. They will wait till LN apps become available to use. Then they will migrate off chain.  At this point Satoshi consensus means very little. It's all about LN. The chain with LN wins. And 2X while you patronized with the miners. Core saw the future. It's not on chain. 

8. So those who are so obligated to this New York agreement stay that way. Divorces are messy. But the kids will stay with whomever has LN. Good luck competing. 2X will never beat 1000 plus transactions per second. This is not personal. It's the reality. 

9. Investors and users here is my advice from experience. Those who fail to embrace the future are the past. Don't put your money into the fastest horse when cars are being built. Know that over time everyone will have a car. The infrastructure will be built to scale the more demand that is needed. ",5,1,1506745478.0

1,"If Bitmain and all the other Bcash supporters stop mining Bitcoin and choose one of the btc-forked altcoins, there are most likely a lot more persons interested in Bitcoin as the real game-changing project in fields of currency, cryptography, decentralization, (soon) anonymity & privacy and of course many new upcoming innovations we never will see in any of the other Bitcoin clones.

That alone will make more regular users interested in beginning mining at home with either some already owned hardware miners or just plenty of fast GPU's.

My guess is then that it wont take long before the first kickstarter projects emerge with the goal of creating a new range of miner hardware that is more effective at less power (since green energy is important apparently) and aiming to get the price down to a level where everybody can participate.

Also the mining software itself should be a whole new area to begin updating by building from scratch, and try to take better advantage of the hardware its running on.
Who knows, maybe someone can figure out a proper way to build a JavaScript miner to replace adds, that actually can make a contribution to the hashpower without overloading the visitors browser or CPU, now that assembler is on its way into new browser. (however I still have my doubts about browser bitcoin mining, but we never know..)

Its should have started sooner already, but Bitcoin and blockchain technology is still a difficult area that takes a tremendous effort to learn. But more and more books, guides and teaching classes are becoming available so it will slowly become easier, and then it will add a lot of new people to the scene with hopefully fresh new ideas for optimization, technology, anything new...

One option to avoid that argument is to increase the number of non-Segwit2X nodes, thus reducing the percentage of Segwit2X nodes and thus reducing Segwit2X's ""user adoption"".

(3) The Trezor/Ledger has a Public & a Private key.  What is the difference between these and when should each be used? What difference is this to the generated address by the Ledger each time a transfer is needed?

(4) The Ledger creates a new address each time a transfer is to be made.  Simply paste this into GDAX....send. And that’s all??

71,"silly question.  Bitcoin gets mined in coins, but can be traded / exchanged in fractional coins all the way down to Satoshi.  Does the block chain have to keep track of every individual satoshi and the associated address, that seem silly slow and wasteful.  So how does blockchain deal with coin unit fragmentation?  My balance could have originated from multiple sources, but when I transfer it all to one address, presumably the part bits have to be transferred rather than a single unit of whatever size.  Given there is full audit tracability in the blockchain of which addresses any part of a coin got transferred through then that argues the fragments have to be tracked.  If that is true.. then while Bitcoin is relatively unpopular / low value the fragments will be larger but if Bitsoin displaces FIAT which will also likely mean the value rapidly grows then transactions will be in ever smaller fractions of a coin and conceivable the whole block of issued coins gets increasingly fragmented into smaller and smaller chunks.  It seem like this would result in transactions becoming increasingly onerous to process / track and the size of the block chain transaction history...

That is NOT what the irs guidance says no matter how many random strangers on the internet throw that out there.
 
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf

And its also NOT what actually happened.

Show me where in the tax code or guidance it says that if you trade one denomination of ""virtual currency"" (the IRS's specific category with its own IRS definition)  for another denomination of  ""virtual currency"" it is a stated taxable event. I will show you several instances in statements and settlements with the IRS and senate that specifically DONT say that and in fact seem to indicate the OPPOSITE.

I beleive the irs and congress intended to exclude the trading of virtual currencies from a taxable event so as not to destroy the important growing industry. I beleive they rightly beleive that having ten ethereum and one bitcoin is very similiar to having a ten dollar bill vs having ten 1 dollar bills and remember swapping those is NOT a taxable event. I beleive that is wise of congress becuase this is all evolving and no one knows what virtual currency differences do and will mean in the long run and theydont want to screw this up.

And the wording of the IRS and The senate oversight committee press releases and the coinbase settlement all seem to indicate i am right and they exclude swapping one virtual currency denomination for another as a stated taxable event. We must assume if they wanted to say it was they would have specifically said it was.

Remember the Irs does treat "" virtual currency"" differently. ""virtual currency"" is literally the irs new definition and hasnt ever existed before and is recognized as differen than anything else. . Its not the same as stocks or gold. They create whole new guidance for ""virtual currency"" becuase they recognized it has unique characteristics.

And if you trade say bitcoin for ethereum on say poloniex you NEVER cashed to fiat because poloniex specifically doesnt allow that...probably SPECIFICALLY NOT to trigger IRS fiat capital gains reporitng requirements because poloniex is a US registered financial institution and know the trouble points afterprobably having extensive discussions with their lawyers because they are a New York registed company.

Remember while the irs guidance says if you trade virtual curency for OTHER PROPERTY or for a SERVICE or if you are PAID in virtual currency  for your services then you owe capital gains or personal income tax as properly calculated.

However in all those statements in the guidance vand senate press release and coinbase settlement) it specifically DOES NOT SAY if you trade VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY it is a taxable event.   

They specifically listed all the OTHER things as taxable events. Since they didnt list virtual currnecy traded for virtual currency  that then we get to assume they DIDNT MEAN IT WAS A TAXABLE EVENT.

You dont get to say ""oh thats what they MEANT to say""

No. If they mean  to say it we get to assume they WOULD HAVE SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WHICH THEY DIDNT.

Again look at the entirety of the guidance   https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf


So you have to back up something when you go beyond guidance and beyond law and create your own rule.

Thanks.

I'm Not being a jerk.

I just need to see the law or guidance you are quoting for your source.

Remember the IRS guindance says only that ""virtual currency"" is a single category of property. It does NOT say different virtual currencies are different properties or types of properties. That is NOT  distinction the IRS has made. 

It does NOT distishguish between different virtual currencies as DIFFERENT  property. So far there is no ruling that says that (that I am aware of.)  

As far as the IRS is concerned they could be thinking that switching from one virtual currency to another is not selling anything. To them it could be like painting your boat a different color. In fact I wouod argue it IS just like painting your boat a different color EVEN if painting it makes it worth more or less value. Its still the same property.  Remember virtual currency is not divisble physical things. Thats why the IRS had to write special guidance in the first place.

Also remember you need to follow guidance and law as written. If it doenst say it you dont assume they meant to say it. You dont make up your own added language.

You file and pay based on actual written law and guidance.

The guidance does NOT say trading only virtual currency is the same as selling and buying other property or even trading other property.


The IRS  DOES saying selling virtual currency for fiat IS a taxable event though.

If the IRS WANTED  to say trading one virtual currency for another is taxable they would have actually said that in the next sentence. They didnt. You dont get to add a missing sentence they didnt write.


*********For further evidencesee tue senate committee notice after the irs guidance was issued.

Notice what they say is taxable and notice they do NOT list ""trading virtual cureency""   as taxable  http://www.nasact.org/files/Federal_Relations/Washington_Update/2014_03_31_Washington_Update.pdf

Hell they specifically say it has some characteristics of currency as legal tender but theydont recognize say bitcoin as different than ethereum any more than they say 10 dollars as ten 1 dollar bills is different than a ten dollar bill and call for taxing that swap.

*******As further evidence  swapping different virtual cureencies has not been ruked taxable i give you Coinbase's settlement with the IRS who wanted Coinbase to give them all usrrs names and coinbase protested saying irs rukes dont apply to their customers and HERE IS WHATTHEY SETTLED ON.

reporting ONLY pekple who received at least $20,000 in CASH for virtual cureency

Quote

>Will Coinbase send me a 1099 or similar form?

>For U.S. users only, Coinbase provides Forms 1099-K to certain business users and GDAX users that have received at least $20,000 cash for sales of cryptocurrency related to at least 200 transactions in a calendar year.

NOT people who traded virtual currencies for other virtual currencies no matter how much they traded. NOT users who withdrew virtual currencies.

Thats a very important point.

And remember that was after coinbase and the IRS had some intense negotiation and thatis whatthey both agreed was relevant for the IRS. So that has meaning.


I suggest that the proper wayto think about how the IRS thinks about virtual currency is that swapping some ethereum for some bitcoin etc is like swapping a ten dollar bill for ten one dollar bills and is not a taxable event. I feel that way becuase all the guidance and senate ststements and their settlement with coinbase all seem to indicate that and excludes swapping  name of virtual cureency for another denomination of virtual currency.  

Of course tommorrow they might change their mind and issue new guidance and the congress who actually makes the laws might agree or disagree. Only congress makes the law on this no matter whattue guidance.


But i dont think it is congresses intent to stifle trading cryptocurrencies with taxes now. I think they want to minimize thst. I think they arecorrect and ots the coreect way to look atit and all the written guidance so far and the coinbasesettlement seems to not contradict me.


(i am not an attoney or tax professional. This is my personal opinion. Many people over pay their taxesevery year. Correctly and legally avoiding taxation that doesnt exist is not illegal and is not evasion. Pay your correct taxes. Dont lie and conceal. This is all a new world. Many rules arent written yet. But never does the court or congress require or intend to require anyone to pay a tax on something that the congress has not said they must pay a tax on)

What does all this mean? it means i am personally comfortable defending in an audit the position that trading different names of virtual currency is NOT a taxable event and I feel comfortable pointing out the evidence in the IRS guidance and senate statements and Coinbase settlement thatdefend tuat position. Of course the IRS could say i misinterpreted and might even fine me a penaltly for late payment of something if they thought i was wrong. (its rare they give you a penatly if there was an honest legitimate different interpretation of unclear matters. )  But that isnt criminal and no different than any other tax filling and certainly better than paying taxes you dont actually owe.  and I am not a tax protest nor would i hide anything or misrepresent anything to the IRS. And I am NOT saying anyone else should.  But nothing i have seen in guidance or senate statements or the coinbase settlement on reporting gives me any reason to think that trading virtual currency denominations is a reportable or taxable event. In fact it all points to the opposite conclusion.


Someone show me a better argument?

One comment on crypto-for-crypto... What you say is certainly true in the new tax bill, for 2018, not sure about 2017.

Side note: The like-for-like exclusion can be seriously annoying. Say you trade BTC @ $10k for LTC @ 0.02BTC. You end buying BTC again at 0.01, so you only get back half of your BTC.

62,"So you Invested in some Bitcoin this year and made some sweet, sweet Fiat? Maybe you traded your Bitcoin, to Etherium. Then maybe you traded your Etherium for some Bitcoin and some Ripple. What are you taxed on? I hope to answer these questions.

**Selling for Fiat**

So the first way that you'll owe GAINS TAX is if you sold bitcoin for money, at a profit! It does NOT matter when you bought the Crypto. It only matters that you sold it in the last year. So if you bought a bitcoin 1 month ago for 8k. And sold today at 13k. You NEED to report a $5,000 on your taxable gains. 

**Trading for Other Crypto**

The other scenerio when you need to report is when you trade for other other currencies. When a trade commences it is treated as you selling and then buying whatever your trading for. So if you bought bitcoin 1 month ago at 8k. And traded it to BCash today while bitcoin was 13k. It is treated that you sold the bitcoin at that price and you need to report the 5k.

This might sound unfair, however the same method is used for trading rare materials (Gold, Silver), Stocks, other fiat currencies, and any other property type investments.

**Multiple Buys and Sells** ^or ^trades...

Note: If you bought Bitcoin at $8k, Sold at 13K Bought at $19k, Sold at $12K... You made $5k, then Lost $7k. So your capital gains is -$2k. You pay the total of all your transactions.

**Short Term** Vs **Long Term**

This is short, but if you sold (or traded) crypto-currencies that you've hedl for over 1 year that is considered a Long Term Investment. If it comes out as a negative you can carry those loses for 7 years. You can not carry loses from short term investments (Bought and sold(traded) in less than 365 days). 

So if you bought bitcoin 2 years ago for $20,000 (You got scammed?) and sold last month for $8k, you have a long term lose of $12,000. This $12,000 lose can be added to your income next year so your gains are less. (They carry over for 7 years).

**Mining**

For miners, Mining income is treated as self-employed income, NOT capital gains tax. When a coin is mined you report the income from the worth of the coin from when it was mined. So if you mined 1 btc (Good job...) 1 month ago at $8k. You'll report $8k under self-employed income. Say you sold that bitcoin you mined last month today for 13k. You will need to report both the 8k income, and the 5k capital gains. (These are taxed at different rates depending on your income...) Expenses are not included in the cost bases. So you WON'T subtract $100 from the 8k. However you can add any expense at the end of the year if you operate your mining operations like a LLC or somthing!

**Final Thoughts**

From my research (Professional accountant, amateur crypto-dude) these are the cases of taxable transactions. If you want Crypto-currency to be taken seriously, you need to treat it like a serious currency, which is taxable. There are ways to reduce your taxes, but I'm not going to outline them, since some of them are grey areas. Also, if you haven't been actively trying to reduce taxes until now... It's too late for 2017. 

Be smart. Hire a professional to assist you if you've made massive gains. It's better to pay a tax professional .05 btc than to lose all your bitcoin because you technically laundered money because of your ignorance. (That doesn't hold up in court).

**Disclaimer**

I'm just some guy typing this at my in-laws house over holiday break. Gone half crazy after spending time with them. While I am a professional accountant, I'm also a random redditor on the internet. Do your own research, or hire someone to do all this for you. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE! ^(Hopefully ^that ^gets ^the ^SEC ^and ^IRS ^off ^my ^back...)

Edit: Missed one... 

**Making a Purchase**

When you buy something! Oh boy! So you treat this as gains from the purchase price of your coin to the sell price of your coin. So if you bought 1 btc for $8k. And you bought a new car for $8k today when BTC was worth $13k. You would pay the gains tax on what you ""Sold"" to buy that car. This gets complicated so I'll try to format it the best I can...

You sold $8,000 worth of the bitcoin that is worth 13K. So 8/13 or .615%. Without going into FIFO or FILO options... We'll consider FIFO (Don't worry about terminology, just giving it incase YOU want to go look it up!)

You'll need to take .615% of your original investment to get your cost basis. $8k * .615 = $4,920.

$4,920 is the amount you'll consider that is your original investment, and you sold for 8k. So your capital gains is $8k - 4,920 = $3,080 <---- This is your taxable gains. THIS IS A TAXABLE EVENT! In regards to transaction fees... Technically The fee is part of the sale, so add that to the total of what was spent. 

There's a bill that is currently being looked at that will make any purchase under $600 non taxable. Until this is passed any purchase is taxable!",310,1,1514700631.0

25,"You guys need to understand that fees were never the only determining factor in confirmation time. Coin age and number of inputs also played a role. Overtime, miners started ignoring these other rules to favor transactions with higher fees.

Of course, those rules don't help for a world-wide payment system. People will spend little bits of newly received bitcoins due to the chaos of making many, many purchases. Meaning, higher fees for daily users.

However, the rules encouraged saving and consolidation of your bitcoins. Holding your bitcoin in a single address would cost less to spend than sending the same amount from multiple addresses (smaller data size per transaction). And sending older bitcoins would take priority over newer received coins.

One can argue, that if miner's stuck to the old rules, it would encourage saving/consolidation which in itself would lower transaction fees. Not only because of following the rules, but because of the decreased transaction volume due to following the rules.

However, following the old rules isn't conducive to a world-wide payment network for daily transactions.

Which, IMO, based on these old rules as well as other, Bitcoin was never meant to be.

My main argument for this post though, is that we don't know which rules the pool chose to confirm these two separate transactions. OP gave no information.

Did the 70sat/B transaction have less inputs and more age than the 1000sat/B? Was the pool practicing altruism in including the transaction? Was there an outside deal done with the pool and sender? ie, confirm my transactions quickly in exchange for free food at my bakery. Was the block already 99% full and the 70sat/B transaction topped off the remaining amount?

Point being, we don't know the reasons or rules followed. So this is a bit of a loaded post OP made.",-1,0,1514736370.0

3. In Electrum, File-->New/Restore-->Standard wallet and click ""Next""

4. Select ""I already have a seed"" and click ""Next""

5. Click ""Options"" box and check ""BIP39"" Seed then click OK

6. input fifteen words from Ian Coleman's site and click ""Next""

7. On the ""Derivation"" screen, replace **m/44'/0'/0'** with **m/49'/0'/0'** and click ""Next""

8. If you want wallet key encryption (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) enter a strong password and store it somewhere safe, then click ""Next""

9. Look at your wallet's addresses: they should all begin with ""3"" (if they don't, start over with a new seed).

10. Enjoy your new SegWit backwards-compatible P2SH-P2PKH wallet.

Bitcoin users can help lower transaction fees and contribute to bitcoin by switching to SegWit addresses and encourage wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**SUMMARY**

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work on integrating it. Others, such as Zebpay in India [have already implemented SegWit](https://blog.zebpay.com/how-zebpay-reduced-bitcoin-transaction-fees-a9e24c788598) and are reaping the benefits of reduced transaction fees. If bitcoin users demand SegWit now it will temporarily relieve the transaction backlog while more even more advanced solutions such as Lightning are developed.

Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it.

There is an opportunity now for all bitcoin users to individually contribute to help strengthen and improve the bitcoin protocol. At this point, the process requires a bit of work/learning on the part of the user, but in doing so you'll actually be advancing bitcoin and leaving what could turn out to be a multi-generational legacy for humanity.

**MEMPOOL/SEGWIT STATISTICS**

- [BitInfoCharts.com - Average Transaction Fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) - $30USD per Tx (down from $40)
- [Blockchain.info - Unconfirmed Transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) - 152K Unconfirmed Tx's (down from 177K)
- [SegWit Charts](http://segwit.party/charts/) - 10% SegWit Tx's

__________________________


**BACKGROUND**

On Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

- SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

- Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

- Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words:

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

- It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses – Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress – use so-called “nested P2SH addresses.” This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address – starting with a “3” – and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to existing wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

 Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

- P2SH starts with ""3...""

 bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
Which addresses can I send from/to?

- P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backwards compatibility

 bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum

Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? 

- The address starting with a ""3..."" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address. The address starting with a ""bc1..."" is a bech32 SegWit address that can only be sent to from newer wallets that support bech32.

If the taxes, penalties, interest and other amounts in dispute exceed $2 million, and a few other qualifications are met, the IRS will pay 15 percent to 30 percent of the amount collected. If the case deals with an individual, his or her annual gross income must be more than $200,000. If the whistleblower disagrees with the outcome of the claim, he or she can appeal to the Tax Court. These rules are found at Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 7623(b) - Whistleblower Rules.



> The IRS also has an award program for other whistleblowers - generally those who do not meet the dollar thresholds of $2 million in dispute or cases involving individual taxpayers with gross income of less that $200,000. The awards through this program are less, with a maximum award of 15 percent up to $10 million. In addition, the awards are discretionary and the informant cannot dispute the outcome of the claim in Tax Court.

What a disaster. With only 5 minutes to spare, I abandoned Bitpay and just paid with PayPal instead.

13,"Bitpay's recent announcement of exclusively using the Bitcoin Payment Protocol (BIP 70) has caused some irritation. No longer can you just send to an address. Now you must use a wallet that supports the protocol, but switching wallets is not all that easy to do. Well never fear, today I am announcing the Bitcoin Payment Protocol Interface. This is a piece of software which lets you interact with the payment protocol manually so that you don't have to switch to using a new wallet software.

The program will take in a bitcoin URI (such as the ones that Bitpay gives out) and it will fetch the payment request data. It then decodes it and shows it to you. You will get to see the addresses to send to and how much. Then, by just following the instructions, you will be able to complete the protocol manually instead of needing a wallet which supports it.

The project is written in Python and has both a command line interface and a GUI. It can be found on Github: https://github.com/achow101/payment-proto-interface

3,"I’ve been wondering this for a long time.

Is the $10,000 limit the maximum amount of bitcoins you can initially buy, or the maximum cost of the goods or service you are buying?

You can read it 2 different ways.

They say “provided the COST of the Bitcoin is under $10,000”. They don’t say “provided the cost of the PRODUCT or SERVICE is under $10,000”

So I would assume that if I bought $9990 worth of Bitcoin and it went to $1,000,000 in 3 years time, I don’t have to pay any tax provided I spend the bitcoin on items directly from my Bitcoin wallet?

Obviously if I cash out anything to fiat, or pay for an item that is asking for AUD (eg: Living Room if Satoshi services) it’s would be taxable. 


That’s what it sounds like to me! How do you guys read it?


From the ATO website:

Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less.

None of it makes any sense at all. If they tax us at-the-time, it means we have to liquidate the asset to pay the effective tax on it. But that means any loss from volatility is a capital loss. So they take our money, and give us paper losses in return. 

The only way that makes sense is to pay the tax on the cashout into fiat. But that raises issues for the ATO as well, because that means you can mine, claim electricity and not pay a darn thing in tax and drain the damn tax system by hindering tax gains to the Government.

I also understand I should keep my mouth shut and not give investing advice. I’m just some guy. 

When I told him to sell BTC was at $14k + and it felt like it was going to dip again. It’s now at $13350. So - I’m not always right - but BTC needs some good news to pump up again. Without it we will dip from $12.9 to $14k everyday.  Highest around noon. Mornings suck. 

However, he bought low - and stood to make 12% (roughly - without going back and looking at his numbers) if he sold when I said. Fine - all good. I didn’t expect him to do what I said. But I expected him to read it - to plant the seed to look elsewhere. 

I’ve been watching XRP for a little more than a year. Their plan is different than BTC - and I knew that if it DID catch on - it would catch on fire. It did - and than it dipped.  It was at 2.40 its now at 1.90. Potential for profit on a $500 investment is much higher with XRP. If it was 2012 - a $500 investment in BtC would be incredible today. 

I play. I invest. 2 different things. I play with XRP. I invest in BtC. I am one of those believers. 

If he sold BtC and bought XRP - made a profit - waited for another dip in BtC - bought BTc - that’s the game.

I discovered BTC when it was $600ish and watched it crawl down to $160 when I eventually bought in around $220. I bought more than I could afford at the time causing me to need to ask my parents for a little money to make rent. They lectured me up and down about my stupid decision buying this virtual fake ""shit"".

Anyways, I kept putting all my paychecks into like a fool but because it was going up and up at this point and I got a Shift btc debit card through coinbase I was able to put 100% of my income into and still pay my bills. 

After a year I decided to create a paper wallet and put 10 BTC in it for my parents as a future surprise gift for all that they had done for me raising me and such. They had no idea how many BTC I had amassed (more than 25 less than 100) and that I still was buying it. I didn't tell them after they went off on me. (some of my income I put in it was from them as I was going to college).

Well today was the final straw. Despite my years of educating myself on the technology and philosophy of what btc is going to become my dad started going off about me to one of his friends how dumb I was for having invested in it years ago. I butted into the conversation and told him it was actually smart because they price is now 14k. Told him for the last few years I have been educating myself on the technology and its potential and the philosophy is sound. He essentially called me an indoctrinated (the irony here is he is Mormon), brainwashed, idiot, that the price is up because its a ponzi, blah blah blah. 

Well I recently got married and will need to get the wife a car and am currently unemployed while I finish my bachelors degree. On top of this I have been obsessed watching the price and its taken a mental toll on myself watching the price go up and down and seeing my wealth grow and I jsut can't keep it a secret anymore. 

So I came to the decision I need to sell a bit to give me some comfort and peace of mind. Pulled the paper wallet out I had created for my parents and sold all 10BTC over the last 12 days :)

Now I face the decision to tell my parents I had put that aside for them or just don't tell them. How big of a dick do I want to be?

TLDR: Invested in BTC. Got scolded by parents. Invested more and set some aside for them without them knowing. Parents still think the idea of BTC is a stupid and anyone who is messing with it is an idiot. Needed to sell some BTC so I sold theirs. Now I don't know if I tell them or not. ",8,1,1514764433.0

It's a pretty simple app really. You create a view only API key, plug it into the app, add your phone number, and then you never have to open the app again. It will send you a text message when your orders fill. (It will work for all GDAX products, not just BTC!)

Here's exactly how it works:

1) Generate **view only** API key (this allows the app to read your completed orders).

2) Provide your phone number/carrier (so I can build your contact email i.e 123456790@txt.att.net)

3) The app will make a request every 60 seconds and record the number of completed orders you have in a database. Every time it checks, it will see if there's a difference in the numbers. If there is, it will build a message with information from that many of your most recent fills (something like buy: X TICKER at $Y total: $Z)

I originally wrote most of the backend Python of this a few months ago and I've been running it on my Raspberry PI and sending me a text when my limit orders fill. The main reason why I wrote this is because I thought it was something crucial that other services didn't offer, and being a Software Engineer I could do quite easily. A bunch of my coworkers who were also into trading cryptocurrency on GDAX really wanted to use it so initially I was just giving them the code but then I decided that since i've always wanted to have an app under my name on the App Store and learn Swift, this would be the perfect opportunity.

I have all of the code publicly visible on my Github [HERE!](https://github.com/leggio/CoinTradeAlerts) The backend API is a flask web server running on an AWS EC2 Instance. The Database is an AWS RDS MySQL database. I've been using Flask for about 2 years and I never really thought that it could be practical for iOS development. It really surprised me how well it worked.
______________________________________________________________________________

Although my code is publicly visible and I am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the API key. Nobody here knows who I am and I fully understand that!

**If you provide anything more than VIEW ONLY your API key CAN be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.**

If anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leggio/Cryptocurrency/master/Fill_Tracker.py) of this code and run it locally on your machine. This means that you are entering your API credentials locally on your own machine.

I am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above.

Although it isn't written directly into the code or mathematics, it's mechanics and structure as described in the white paper speak louder than words. That is, what is implied cannot be understated.

Bitcoin's unique property comes from decentralization. You've heard that before, but why do we care about such a thing? Because we've seen what centralization does. The abuse of power that comes from centralization is documented throughout history. And it hasn't been stopped by democratic government. Net neutrality? Trashed. Temporary ""Patriot Act"" to infringe on all your constitutional rights in the name of security? Yeah, that's permanent. Big bank bailouts? Sure. National ID (Papers)? Coming soon.

So how does Bitcoin fit into solving this? It's really three ways in my mind:

1. By stopping the government from being able to print/create infinite amounts of dollars and thus creating an insidious and immoral tax on your savings in order to fund endless wars and unjustified/illegal abuses of money and power around the world.

2. A brilliant seed of intellectualism that can begin to spread into the rest of the world that desperately needs it. That is, a system of mathematical certainty (in the form of cryptography) to back economic principles guided by logic and non-aggression rather than political motivations. This has the potential to undo the damage done by ""every stupid voter's voice still counts"". In Bitcoin, everything is a meritocracy. There are consequences to stupidity on many levels. From rash/buggy/incorrect decision-making on the protocol level to the rash/idiotic decision-making in terms of over-investing or buying/selling improperly. This system has the potential to start educating people, brilliantly disguised as a get-rich scheme. We've learned in 2017 that attacks like BCash and Miner's Voice are not significant. And those who thought incorrectly were burned. We witness attempts to attack Bitcoin on many fronts, with the conjuring of conspiracy theories and non-intellectual discussions which is resisted by those who can make better intellectual decisions. Propaganda systems are actually weak against Bitcoin, because mathematical truth cuts through the noise like butane flames through butter.

3. Redistribution of wealth which will free many minds from government slavery. Imagine what would happen if massive numbers of people who owned Bitcoin grew large, and those people no longer needed to work? Some would retire, live a life of luxury, or whatever their ""affluenza"" disease makes them do. But those people are pretty much lottery ticket winners. These are pure speculative investors, and they don't control Bitcoin or will be part of creating a new future. Then there are those who save their wealth in Bitcoin (notice, I didn't say invest). These people believe that the government has gone too far, it's destroying the planet and humanitarianism of civilized people. When you take people with such a mindset, and empower them with the ability to quit their meaningless job and start to poke and prod at government, this is a huge and healthy threat to government. What happens when 10%, 20%, 50% of the population simply doesn't have to work as much because the value of Bitcoin can sustain them? Well, the government will likely step in before their own currency implodes with rules attempting to ban Bitcoin or even taxing Bitcoin at 50% or emergency Bitcoin tax at 90% in order to ""save the economy"". And these people, who don't have to work, will have plenty of time to counter the government in all directions - legal, political, and in extreme cases physical.

Will there be a 2nd American Revolution? I don't know for sure. 

But what Bitcoin has planted here, is an opportunity for non-aggression principles to spread to rid the disease of corrupt governments, endless war, environmental destruction, extreme poverty, global inequalities, anti-intellectualism (in turn creating stupid voters), immoral greed and capitalist problems, and finally take a step towards peace.

So if you're feeling uneasy about Bitcoin, you're probably still in it for the quick gains. Which is fine, and I hope you do make a lot of money. If you do, spend the new free time you have to learn about the bigger implications. But if you're in Bitcoin for these reasons that I described above, the price doesn't matter, ""HODL"" never-ever needs to be repeated, and it is almost unconscionable to perpetuate earth's destruction by doing otherwise.

- Healthy growth at this stage may be more people owning it. Not many are looking to spend it at this point. We will get there.
- Bitcoin had such a lead right now that I don't think it will be caught. Just my opinion.
- Governments cannot regulate crypto. They will get they're cut in taxes. Evade taxes at your peril.
- To the other poster, new cryptos may work better because they are less used. Also, Bitcoin is able to morph and integrate new ideas if it benefits the currency. It's not written in stone.

Think about that for a moment.

Edit: Going by the rest of the comments on this thread, I don't think people here quite appreciate the insane amount of trading in South Korea at the moment. The technology there is ridiculous. Your account is approved instantly by linking your phone number (which is already linked to your social security equivalent ID). You can withdraw to your bank account within 10 minutes any time of the day, for most of the popular banks. In fact it's easier to withdraw than to deposit fiat. You can pretty much trade in and out of crypto and fiat instantly, with almost no friction along the way, and a $1 fee for the withdrawal, up to $50k per day for a level 1 verified account.

How much you buy is completely subjective - if you can afford to lose $1000, more power to you! 

I’m utilizing two strategies: long term holding, and altcoin trading.

Holding is fun but you may feel like you’re not doing anything, so altcoins are an interesting way to expand your cryptocurrency familiarity while also potentially making you some decent money. I usually wait till I come across a project that seems practical, ie: that addresses a real-world problem. 

Never buy into an altcoin solely because you saw some random comment on the Internet saying how it’s going to explode - always do your own research. I’ve bought into a few projects that I abandoned after digging deeper than usual.

The most obvious example is Krugman. World renown economist.....sure, but also a complete failure when it comes to understanding and predicting the impact of Bitcoin.

3,"I'm a Msc Economics student (research field), and I mostly just lurk here because the psychological mechanisms behind the hype are pretty interesting to witness. Also, a lot of the threads and comments in here are pretty entertaining.

However, most of the times, it saddens me to see how many people base their speculations on nonsense strategies without having even a basic understanding of concepts such as supply and demand, and how they interact with each other to determine market prices. People think they understand, but most of the economic theory you find in here doesn't make sense and is plain wrong. 

In our classes, we don't spend much time discussing Bitcoin at all. It is considered to be a purely speculative asset, and no-one is willing to risk guessing what direction it will go to, because we simply cannot do valid predictions. Not all economists agree, but it is very likely we are watching a bubble burst, which is not a bad thing at all because the world knows about blockchain now, people see opportunities and others see threats. All in all, this gave a massive boost to innovation which is ultimately the most important thing.

We do, however, spend time discussing the blockchain and what opportunities and threats it brings along. There is absolutely no doubt the technology can be ground-breaking and completely redefine our financial system, and probably the most interesting thing about it is its potential to provide access to financial services for the poor and lower class people that don't have it now. Therefore, a lot of research is done investigating its potential in developing countries and how it could contribute to e.g. retail markets and potentially redefine concepts such as property etc, which remains a big issue over there.

Anyway, TLDR: economists focus on the opportunities and threats of the blockchain, and how it can potentially define the future and our monetary system. We do not really care about Bitcoin and its price development as long as banks aren't massively invested, which was the case in 07-08. ",11,0,1522498939.0

28,"The primary purpose of studying economics is *to not be hornswoggled by economists.* I do have some formal economics education (enough during my degree study to qualify for an associates in economics and be on the way to a bachelors) but the truth is that economics is far more art than science. Economists will never admit that to you - as economists all think they're very smart, and also rely upon the seeming scientific laws of economics to retain work - but the primary useful function of economists is investigation.

A good analogy would be to consider an economy an organism. It's alive, it's functioning (or malfunctioning) and moving value and wealth here and there using the systems in place within it by the cells of that system. Think of an economy as one creature, organizations that create value as organs, organizations that serve to distribute value as other organs, systems that transfer things as organ systems and people that require value as cells. In this analogy an economist is not so much a surgeon or doctor or lawmaker as they are a post-mortem crime scene investigator. 

Yeah, they try to predict how people will behave and do experiments to influence activities and there are some simple successes but never forget that an economy and ""THE"" economy is made up of people who live within it who are studying it every single day just like the economist is. They're adapting to market forces, trying to create their own, constantly looking to change things to their advantage or keep things to their advantage or TAKE advantage, etc., in the game of maximum reward for minimum effort aka value.

So while you and I might say, oh, put Coca Cola on sale and charge more for Pepsi an economist is more interested in exactly what % of a sale price on Coke is necessary before people purchase Coke at a greater % speed than the discount and if flooding the shelves with Coke bottles would increase or decrease that effect, etc.

For example there was a power company many decades ago that built a power plant. This is a true story. They had tons of dirt left over from digging a foundation. Good, rich soil and loam for planting. Put an ad in the paper - FREE SOIL. Nobody came. Someone had the idea to charge for it. $5 A BAG SOIL was the next ad.

I'm not going to mention my own formal education, but I have a few economist friends (one a PhD) who have been following cryptos with some interest. It's revived a bit of Austrian economics interest in them, but they still view it with a very healthy bit of skepticism.

The thing that often comes up is Thiers law when I talk with them about Bitcoin. There's a rekindling of interest in works by Rolnick and Weber and the sorts of stuff they call my ""fringe Austrian beliefs"". I don't get the sense that they see Bitcoin as anything more than a fad, but for one brief moment while the price was rising late last year one of them admitted that ""the whole of mainstream economics is now on trial"" while immediately backpedaling as the price began to fall this year and the ""markets are now returning to sanity"" as he ""predicted"".

In a business environment you often put paper into peoples hands because its easier than having everyone have their own personal laptop, tablet, whatever for the meeting. Im a super technolgist who would never print a email for himself, but the demands of a corporate environment are not about what I need, but about what is most efficient for many (for that meeting per say).

The business world is what churns the most email/paper, so we have to consider that in the future businesses will be a large part of the crypto ecosystem.

I get your point, im just not sure its as strong as you think it is. It has a maximal feeling to it, when it should really be considered in terms of a ratio, one that slowly changes over decades. Maybe crypto vs usd use is 0.000000000000000000001:1 today, and it might lose a decimal or two in the next year, but its going to be slow going.

I also used to work in the reprographic industry, so im quite familiar with exactly how much paper businesses still use *today*. Lets just say Dunder Mifflin paper aint going out of business anytime soon, regardless of how many people use email.

I still have to tell businesses on a weekly basis that I refuse to send them faxes and that when they are serious about doing business with clients they can forward me their email.

We live in a society that takes *many* generations for legacy technology to disappear. Fax has been outdated for nearly 2 decades now and the entire medical and financial industry *still* relies upon it.

Why should we assume the same wont apply to dollars vs bitcoin? Maybe you are right in that we will have more options in exchanging btc for goods, but there will *always* be a dependency on USD in our lifetimes.

1,"> So heres the thing about a 7k bitcoin...It's still frickin amazing

This depends entirely at what price you entered the market.

If you bought in at $100 then yes $7k puts you miles ahead where you started.  Of course when it was at $20k you had 3 times as much money as you do now, but those are still very solid gains.

What if you bought at $7k last November and held until now?  You watched your money nearly triple on the way up from $7k to $20k and watched every single cent of gains disappear on the ride back down to $7k again.  These people probably lament not selling at the peak instead of thinking that $7k is a great price.

Now imagine you bought in at 10k, 12k, 15k, 18k or even 19.9k.  How do you feel about a $7k price point now?  Most people in that boat aren't too excited about btc at the $7k level.",92,0,1522464608.0

> The technology looks to replace bitcoin’s existing signature scheme with one that mashes signature data together. The concept is so attractive partly because it clears up space in the blockchain, which should help resolve both the transaction backlog and high fees bitcoin users sometimes need to deal with.

...

> However, before SegWit implementation, it has not been possible to utilize Schnorr in Bitcoin.

...

> Four Bitcoin developers have released a paper outlining how Schnorr multi-signatures (‘multisig’) can help scale the Bitcoin Blockchain.

...

> Schnorr signatures are more efficient and compact than ECDSA signatures. 

 ...

> With Schnorr, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures.  [...] This means there’s more room for transactions. [...] As a side effect, a smaller transaction fee is achieved.

...

> Another major benefit of Schnorr signatures, is increased privacy

...


> In MultiSig, transaction inputs will only require one signature to represent all individual signatures, which is a “convenience” and data improvement.

...

> Combined with the CoinJoin protocol, Schnorr signatures allow users to combine their transactions and signatures at the same time.

...

> Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier estimated it would take several years for Schnorr signatures to be implemented.

...

> Schnorr’s signature would provide a reduction in transaction sizes anywhere from 19% for single input transactions, up to 40% when applied to multisig

And finally, bitcoin is not bitcoin core or any specific client. Users can run several different client today to follow and validate the bitcoin consensus rules. 
It's the users of the network who decide what consensus rules they follow (and therefore what define Bitcoin). If a consensus rule change is introduced by developers or other actors into bitcoin core (or into other clients) and it doesn't have consensus of the users/economic nodes then it will never become part of bitcoin's consensus rules (see fiasco of 2x).

9,"For a while now I've been working on a little project. I call it *Crypto Trade Manager*.

The main purpose of the application is to read trade history files in a *generic* way. I first 
started implementing functions for importing export files from specific exchanges, but then I
realized there are way too many, and they all look somewhat similar.

The way Crypto Trade Manager works, is that the user defines the format of the trade history file 
he wants to import. This can be done by filling up a form with different parameters in the UI of
the application (which is a little time consuming). Once this form is completed, and the
trade history has succesfully been imported, the user can save the parameters to a file.
This file can then be used later for importing trades from the same exchange.

I wouldn't say the application is 100% complete, but I would like to release a version to the community.
I hope some people here would like to try it out, and give some feedback (negative and positive).
I still have a bunch of features I want to implement, but I need some opinions from users if I will continue on this.

Some the features implemented now:

* Import of trade histories using UI form or input file
* Manual Add, Edit, Delete, Convertion of Trades, Desposit and Withdrawals
* Tabular overview of all transactions
* Tabular overview of portfolio/holdings over time (automatically calculated based on trades)
* Current portfolio (automatically calculated based on trades)
* USD value of portfolio over time based on CoinCap.io data
* USD value of porfolio based on CoinmarketCap data
* Graphical plot of porfolio value over time (automatically calculated based on trades)
* Everything (almost) can be exported to excel (or copy/pasted directly from tables)

I made a very simple website where you can download the application:

* www.cryptotrademanager.org

I've started on User Guide on the website (not completed), but a video says a 1000 words, so I made:

* Short introduction video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpVgpsJ8GOU&

* Long introduction video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBszOXjSNDs&


Lastly, I need to mention, I'm not a developer. Programming is more of a selflearned hobby.
There are probably still a bunch of bugs which I haven't encountered yet. This is also why I
hope some of you would like to try it out and give feedback.

Thank you all!

4,"I've mentioned before that I'm an old hand when it comes to Bitcoin but while it was nice to see the surging 'interest' in Bitcoin towards the end of last year, I was keenly aware that Bitcoin's utility had not scaled in proportion and the price was driven solely by institutional interest.

Retail interest is manipulated by institutional disposition towards Bitcoin. They own the media. They own your psyche, your thoughts, your decisions.

'What do you mean by institutional disposition?', you ask? Nation states and their banks.

If you think fiat price matters, I only have one question. What is Bitcoin to you? If the answer is 'a speculative asset to print new bank money', you should get the hell out of here and head over to the stock market.

The world we live in today is not a far cry from feudalism, even in so-called democracies, however much we are brainwashed into believing the polite fiction that is force-fed to us.

Banks are our feudal lords, each nation-state a fiefdom and every common man a serf. They print money out of nothing, inflating the economy and we keep paying interest on nothing, all the while diminishing the purported value of the money we hold which was created from nothing.

Why does nothing have value at all? Because we endorse this paradigm. Borderless currency is bad news for this paradigm.

Now let me tell you what Bitcoin really is,

Bitcoin is a new economic paradigm, where, for the first time in the history of money, every man gets to live in a truly democratic society with economic autonomy.

Bitcoin is not an asset that has value in bank money. Bitcoin is here to destroy bank money. Bitcoin is the everyman's money.

Bitcoin's true value will be its own purchasing power. How will Bitcoin have purchasing power? The same way bank money obtained purchasing power.

We just need to endorse this brave new paradigm. 'We' does not include banks or nation states, but we, the people!

Bitcoin is ingenuity. Satoshi is to Economics what Darwin was Evolution and Galileo to Science.

Most of us are just too benighted and brainwashed to appreciate the power of Bitcoin.

What would happen if we all ditched the bank money they keep printing out of nothing at will and bought into Bitcoin?

Is this the Calm before the Storm? ...any thoughts guys?

u/Moosecountry05 - 3y

With over 300 million in Venture Capital Funding for Bitcoin, all the new innovations and big players about to move in from the wall street and the start ups we don't even know about yet that are being worked on. I feel like everyone is playing hush hush, and one morning we all will wake up to a huge media blitz on how bitcoins being traded for over 1000 on the stock markets and other country's are joining the band wagon and push it up to 2,000. There's so many people in high places that have invested into Bitcoin that they would be able to push it mainstream to get back there money, just a matter of when.

In my uneducated opinion, it is very unlikely to hold for a long period of time at stable prices. Investors are terrified of bear markets as they don't want to see their money shrink. But as soon as the bear market finishes- and there is stability- the fear will disappear and investors will rush in. As soon as they start to do this, signs of a bull market will appear, causing even more investors to rush in, creating a virtuous circle (for those of us who got in before anyway), causing the next in a long line of bubbles.

18,"A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Users

The Techbros (see also The True Believers) - they're really into the internet of everything.  They think analog money is antiquated.  They're digital 24/7 and money should be no exception.  They're huge believers in the future of blockchain and can nerd out in the technology all day long.  Hodlers highly present. Subset of Techbros are the True Believers that think Bitcoin has the power to change the world, right all wrongs, create equality where there is none.

The Criminals - Bitcoin is merely utilitarian.  It allows easy transfer in exchange for contraband.  It provides an avenue of commerce for all kinds of illicit behavior from illegal drugs to sex trafficking to terrorism to money laundering.  

The Day Traders - they're not in it for the tech, they're in it for the rush.  They couldn't care less about blockchain (hell, they might not even understand it). They see a volatile asset that can be exploited for gain.  It could be oranges for all they care - anything that moves this fast can be profited off of if you know how to play the game.

The Hedge Funds - Institutional traders that agglomerate huge sums of capital that can be then used to manipulate markets.  It's a market and they're going to be present because they can move it or because they can manage the risk.  

The Libertarians (see also former Goldbugs, and Trumpkins)- fringy right-wingers that distrust central banks, and really, government of all kinds.  They think money should be deflationary and hate the idea that central banks can ""print money"" and undermine the value of their cash.  For some reason the idea of storing wealth in other assets that rise in value never occurs to them and they often confuse assets with money. They're highly resentful that trades in bitcoin are taxable events and hold things like ""taxes are theft"".  The extreme libertarians trade in conspiracy theories about jews and global banking.  In a prior generation they would have been advocating for return to a gold standard - this is the new gold standard to them.  

The Black Hats - Anarchists (left and right) that want to burn the system down.

Aunt Sally - Aunt Sally doesn't know anything about bitcoin really, but she's heard people talking about it and she's curious enough to put some money into it.  Aunt Sally has a lot of questions.  She's a little disappointed in you right now.

FOMOs (see also bandwagonners) - *sigh* these are lambs lead to the slaughter.  They see people around them getting fabulously wealthy instantly and want in.  They tend buy at the steepest part of the chart on the way up, and sell at the steepest part of the chart on the way down.

The Ruskies - Russians are exceptionally adept at identifying any weakness in western hegemony and then driving a wedge into it.  Bitcoin provides yet another avenue to throw a stink bomb into the system.  Their use is purely exploitative.  ",2,0,1530375537.0

1,"See, perhaps I'll be downvoted for this sort of thing, but this is the sort of news that gets me thinking that Bitcoin hasn't delivered, and I doubt ever will deliver, on the dream of ""beating the system"". It might change it somewhat, it might have to adjust, but I don't buy into the anarchocapitalistic utopic dreams of some.

Let's call it the ""house"", as in the saying ""the house always wins"". The ""house"" being international banking, oil companies, IMF, WTO, Davos Forum, US government, the CIA, corrupt politicians, whatever. The guys with money, and their henchmen. Some people dream Bitcoin can beat the system - beat ""the house"".

What I see here is it might help beat the Venezuelan government, and the wreck the Bolivar by contributing to the hyperinflation as people perceive the Bolivar as more and more worthless and try to park whatever money they can on USD black market, crypto, whatever. Crypto has the special property of its transactions being hard to track and you can't easily find out who is in possession of BTC and how much. It's like USD black market, but ""superior"" in some aspects.

Well, one thing I can say for sure is the Venezuelan govt. and the Bolivar are not the system, the system is actually their enemy and BTC here can only collaborate with it.

On the other hand before BTC would ever ""save"" people from the Dollar, and the international banking/financial system, or even the Chinese regime we would see any manner of drastic measures to protect the real powerful and these stronger institutions. Best case scenario for BTC ""beating"" the house, is the house just joining it and buying into cryptocurrency world for greater gains, corruption and fraud than we have ever seen.

It doesn't matter how much BTC you are HODLing, the house has taken note of cryptocurrency and we have shady characters manipulating it and profiting many times more. The world of cryptos is like a wild west, we have stuff like USDT in exchanges that is like, a dollar, but not a real dollar that can be redeemed with actual dollars and yet it has likely manipulated those markets massively. I am convinced crypto markets today are on par, or perhaps more shady and underregulated than the regular financial market, 95&#37; of things traded have no value (shitcoins), it's more casino than Wall Street.

So however smart we may think we are by buying / HODLing some BTC / investing small time in crypto, they will outsmart you and own it, as they always do.

But Venezuela? Heh, maybe it can ""save"" Venezuelans from Maduro by breaking their currency and making Venezuela a failed state. Way to go for the e-currency revolution.

As a disclaimer, this is not to detract from the tech itself which gets ever more impressive in my opinion. It always impresses me that bitcoin **works**, today, as actual money. The system works, and it was never hacked. It just feels so futuristic. But I just don't think blockchain tech alone will defeat the powerful.

I am personally more of a fan of next generation blockchain projects like ETH and their cousins though. If NEO in China promises to bring innovative computing to make the system more efficient and clean, and delivers on the promise, I think it's a win. I'm okay with it not being a ""rebel"" coin. I don't believe in ""rebel"" coin tearing down the status quo. It's more convenient than fiat sometimes personally but that's it for me.

So far I have seen no sign that crypto money is bringing the financial elites to their knees, ever. What I do see in news concerning Venezuela is it potentially collaborating with them to breaking a rebellious regime and putting the country back in line. When it breaks, they come in and profit, nothing new. New ""democratic"" regime comes in, takes massive loans from IMF, massive austerity measures to ""fix"" everything, privatize PDVSA and its oil for Exxon-Mobil / Shell / whoever, so on and so forth. Lots of profit to be had, and let's be honest, mostly in Dollars.

They then waitd for the price to hit about $5800, and did the exact same thing again.

I'd hazard 21 million was chosen because the Earth's population may be in the 21 billion region by the time the last bitcoin is minted in 2140 (a theory I've also just pulled out of thin air).

Coin A is $10 worth. You bought one coin A. It appreciates in value and now it's worth $20. You decide to trade it for coin B, which at the time of trade is $5 worth. So you trade one coin A for four coins B.   

What people don't get is that you just triggered a taxable event, because you made a profit of $10, and you have to paid tax on those $10, even though you never converted coin A into fiat.  

To make things worse, if coin B suddenly loses all its value while you hold it, you still owe taxes on your  profits, even if you never ""cashed out"" into fiat.

Then he told me that he can save escrow fees by using [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet and insisted in trading using that system else he wont trade. Since, I hadn't used [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet, I didn't know this feature existed there :/ He began explaining me how it works.

Thereafter, I can change the password of my [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) account to make sure he cannot open my wallet anymore. I smelled something very very fishy  still gave the man the benefit of doubt as I hadn't used [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet and told him to show me a demo by doing a transaction of $1 worth bitcoins. He agreed and I gave him the credentials of a demo account. Then he told me to confirm an email authorizing login from an unknown browser. I did it as it was a demo account and a demo email id too. Soon he told me to login to my wallet and click on send. I could see a ""watch-only"" address with balance of 0.002 BTC and needed a private key to send funds from that wallet. He told me that I already had the bitcoins in my wallet and needed that private key or ""escrow key"" which he would tell after I had sent him money. I was astonished to how dumb this scam is.

0,">""We're stuck in time... We can't move forward and backward in time...""

Au contraire Neil.  We absolutely can - in our minds... and in doing so, we effect *actual* reality.  

When Steve Jobs delivered his [Stanford Commencement speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA) in 2005 he said the following:

""You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.""  

Looking back on our past enables us to look to it from different perspectives, gain new insights and *change that past*.  We've all had that ""Aha!"" moment when new information in the present casts our understanding of past events in a new light and we then reorder our memories... In doing so, we effectively *change* that past.  

You're probably familiar with the maxim:

""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past."" — George Orwell

Things get really interesting when we *collectively* begin to re-order our understanding of the past.  In fact, that's what's going on in the bitcoin world en masse, as millions of people began to ask ""Why did Henry T. Ford say there would be revolution before breakfast if the average person understood banking?""

As politicians and ordinary folk on the street begin to look into the history of banking and have collective ""Aha!"" moments, those (no doubt with good intentions) who sought to control the past have less and less authority over the present.  Just as those that sought to maintain segregation during the civil rights movements of the past began to lose their grip of that particular reality.

And so we begin to look toward a different future as a new adjacent possible comes into view.

That future is a battleground of ideas and information. They who have greater access to truthful information in this new collaborative era are better able to join those dots moving forward since there is less noise to cut through and, more importantly, less competition over ideas of what that future might look like thanks to consensus driven frameworks that allow the best ideas to take hold with less friction. 

**The greatest force multiplier on the planet has always been technology.**  

Steve Jobs was able to time travel 10 years into the future by imagining a world of smartphones in his minds eye and convincing the world to go in that direction.  Satoshi was able to do the same with the bitcoin whitepaper.  Before satoshi, Tim Berners-Lee who imagined what a world where every computer was connected might look like.  Before him, Captains of the great pirate ships that controlled information and trade routes and were the first humans to realise (and see the implications of) the world not being flat.

Whilst no-one has absolute control or authority over the future since there are way too many chaotic events that will unfold as the dots are being joined...  one can attempt to ""fight all the battlegrounds of ideas at once"" in the minds eye, and instantiate 'backup plans' for the various possible futures that may unfold.  In fact governments and think tanks are thinking 10-50 years ahead all the time - it's how we've gotten this far as a species. 

Computer scientists and engineers are very good at building backup plans.  Taking unintended consequences into account is what all good programmers do when designing fail-safe systems.

The complex part the modern world has faced in all this has been keeping up with the sheer pace of change now that the moving variables (and unintended outcomes) are being compounded by the speed of instantaneous (and democratised) information transfer that the internet has brought about... Consensus driven 'hive mind' networks like bitcoin will increasingly be used to augment the role of old world institutions that used to do all this in the paper-belt world.  

**None of this is new.**

In antiquity the role of shaping the future of humanity was carried out by the [Pythia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia) - high priestesses of the Delphi in Ancient Greece - who would make a number of prophesies that people would act upon.  These Oracles would give advice intended to shape future action, which would be implemented by the supplicant seeking advice.  These supplicants would be known as ""consultants"" and would leave the Oracles and carry out certain duties on the basis of their advice.  By virtue of the wide-ranging information networks the Pythia had been exposed to they were, in essence, polymaths 

There were other oracles (or prophets) like Jesus, Moses, able to do a similar thing...  Note how well travelled they were in the stories and the sheer amount of novelty they had been exposed to above and beyond the average citizen.  They too were polymaths able to shape the future and change reality in profound ways.

Amazing material scientists like Neil who fail to see reality is made out of language and thought... get all caught up on the whole ""did Jesus exist?"" thing and rather miss the point... Carl Sagan (my favourite scientist of all time) even missed this when he said ""Astrology is bunk, the position of the planets at your birth has far less effect than the gravitational pull of the midwife delivering you.""  

That's irrelevant: all that matters is that the inter-subjective systems of belief that dictate the alignment of those stars will define the kind of character traits you are likely to have in life...  That, and the attachment we have to the various symbology we surround ourselves with that imbue those belief systems with certain powers (Scorpions are scary and dangerous, Lions are brave and noble etc).  A [Nazar amulet](youtube.com) wards off evil in the exact same way a modern depiction of the iris below a CCTV camera sign does.

So... if enough people in China believe a person being born in the year of the Fire Dragon is going to be a great powerful leader then they are going to subconsciously give preference to Fire Dragons over, say, Water Rats when selecting for the position of a CEO.  Therefore, Fire Dragons *do* hold more power in this world because of that selection bias... That makes it a self-fulfilling prophesy.  And it absolutely *does* matter what star you are born under, no matter what material scientists that fail to see *actual* reality, have to say about it.

I mean, I assume Neil knows - like all good material scientists ought to - that a bank note is less valuable than shit (since things grow from shit)... Yet I don't hear him telling the world that money is not 'real'.  Neil himself, is subject to the same power of belief structures as the astrologists he will pooh-pooh.

**""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.""** 

Astrology, Jesus, Capitalism, Hollywood: it's all 'real' if people *believe* it is 'real'; just like money and bitcoin are 'real' because we 'believe' them to be so.

If you want to know what the future looks like then, you only need to travel there in your mind like Steve Jobs did and ask yourself what you would like that future to look like.  If the vision you have is something you think would be of benefit to the other 7 billion humans on the planet, then there's a high degree of probability your vision is gonna' come true as soon as it [crosses the chasm](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) of belief and gathers the network effect.

5,"It is my strong belief that ""Time"" is the most valuable resource that we Humans have access to...

As Neil deGrasse Tyson so eloquently quoted ""[Time is defined to make motion look simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPOR55M_P0)""; what he's saying here is that the only reason we have a ""need"" for the concept of ""Time"" is to allow us a unit of measurement to describe motion effectively...

There is evidence that Time is our most valuable resource when you look back in History: The first accountants were ""time-keepers"" ie. the first astronomers! They first used motion to delineate a unit of time by realizing the Sun that rises and falls, this is presumably the first unit of time ever invented. This smaller unit of measurement (day) was used to delineate and measure other movements of greater celestial objects and eventually it helped us figure out where we were in the galaxy! It is no coincidence the first accountants were accountants of time or ""time-keepers"", it is VALUABLE!

[A drawing of early astronomers, accounting for \\""Time\\"" by using the motion of celestial bodies...](https://preview.redd.it/wsztcwo697711.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f229814efc49e21cabed689c5ff5c8dc3e351b4a)

They knew not what they were measuring, but they didn't need to know, they saw something repeat; thus a unit of time was created... If you have something that repeats predictably, you've created a time-keeping mechanism...

One could argue that Time is the only resource we truly ""have"", but one could also successfully debate that ""Time"" itself is a tool to help us accomplish things more predictably, thus preserving a bit of Time... This is quite literally the only use we have for Time, it is primarily why we invented it back when our ancestors looked at stars...

[Ask somebody for ALL their Money, and then ask them for ALL their Time, same result?](https://preview.redd.it/lk3osuzu97711.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92274ae64e097dd3fe9e2a8f2bfcca7d6bc99563)

If something saves you time, it is money... The reason is because Time IS money... When you buy a pack of bubble gum, you are buying the time necessary to create that product. When you work, you get paid for your time. Time IS money... This is why when you give somebody money and then wait a few years, you should expect a return of some kind, you gave them the money PLUS the time, this is the entire reason why ANY interest EVER is paid on ANYTHING... TIME!

The man who can waste somebody else's time is truly wicked, but that is a subject for a different post, let's get right to the Hero:

Lightning Network

Now that you know the importance of time, and therefore money, you should see the potential lying dormant in the Lightning Network...

When BILLIONS of people around the world can transact near instantaneously, we will see a compound interest effect upon both the time AND money savings that are offered to ALL of Humanity...

We have planes that can cross the Atlantic Ocean faster than any form of Global Money; this is truly unacceptable for the 21st Century, Lightning Network will solve this problem, and it will do it quickly...

HyperBitcoinization was never just about ""fast-money"", it was about ""fast-everything""...

2,Very likely the best Andreas speech of 2018.  Don't let any noobs or intermediate bitcoiners miss this one!,2,0,1530436105.0
3,"I fucking love Andreas, I think he honestly and adamantly *cares* about the good that bitcoin can do in the world and that's why he does what he does. He gets emotional when he gets to the core of his description of why bitcoin is important to humanity, you can hear it in his voice.

But I still feel the need to critique what is essentially an anarcho-capitalist vision of equality, or I guess more accurately justice. I know a significant portion of this sub and BTC's userbase would call themselves ancap, many with honest conviction, and so this applies to you too.

I'm an an**com** and so agree wholeheartedly with the idea that proprietary money is a cancer on modern society, and I'm attracted to bitcoin specifically because it is a way to help wrest control from those proprietary systems to the benefit of almost everyone. But, I do so from a place of theory, because no conviction or choice can have a dependable outcome if you can't back it up with an understanding of why. And as a ancom the theory is that the *primary* cancer, the root of all oppression, is unjustified hierarchy: A power inequality that is not mutually revocable, ie able to be cancelled by any participant, without coercion. One can think of dozens if not hundreds of injustices in our society - And proprietary control of money is one of the big ones, which bitcoin is managing to crack - But unjust hierarchy tends to be the common trait throughout all of them.

So when ancaps get excited about the utopia they envision bitcoin creating, I die a little despite sharing a similar-if-not-lesser enthusiasm, because I see them missing one of the biggest unjust hierarchies of all, capitalism (Which I don't confuse with the concept of abstract value represented through money, which is inescapable but completely separable from capitalism). A system that not only encourages but can be shown to *rely* on wealth inequalities and therefore power inequalities, protected by the state, perfectly matches the definition of an unjust hierarchy. I think that we should be excited about the progress toward egalitarianism that bitcoin *may* be unlocking. But I do not think that we should describe it as the herald of utopia because it's really just one small piece of a large puzzle.

Of course I also prefer bitcoin over USD because, as an American generally coerced into capitalism, I have more faith in it's investment capability! However I just consider that a rather large bonus for what is first and foremost an attempt to knock down an injustice. One critique of anarcho-capitalism (Sorry I know I'm throwing a lot at you guys, thanks for humoring me) is that capitalism's wealth disparities, if allowed to continue unregulated, would result in so much power disparity that it would create something akin to feudalism. But, another critique of anarcho-capitalism, or actually just capitalism in general, is that the power disparities it creates actually *require* the protection of a state to maintain, and therefore general respect for such disparities and therefore the economic system itself would dissolve without such support. So as there will *always* be, under even most communal or socialistic economic models, a need to represent value in abstract form, and as the only technological means we have so far to do so justly is bitcoin, I don't see it going away under *any* scenario (Save for apocalyptic conditions where the computers stop working :P ). 

Andreas is right about *money* being necessary to secure bitcoin and any other trustless mechanisms that ride on top of it due to how incentives are organized in capitalism. The whole thing just won't work without there being an abstract value layer, this is a fact that I must concede. But I'm still holding out hope for alternative proofs of work that would be more compatible with alternative economic models that don't prioritize endless expansion and competition (Expressed here through mining) for the times after all the big hierarchies get toppled and ecology becomes a significant priority. Like a democratic confederation somewhere where all legislation and proceedings documented on-chain required cryptographic signing by all parties affected before they could be verified aka 'enacted' and those collective signings would stand in for PoW. Variants like that. I think that a lot of potential very-viable *blockchain* alternatives to bitcoin could exist, just not in our economic paradigm. But hey maybe bitcoin will help us get there one day. Wow thanks for reading all of this.",2,0,1530396367.0

However, I don't think any system (inflationary, fixed, deflationary) will achieve price stability. Prices are better left being determined by the free market. What you can try to predict is market behaviour given different properties of money. With the existing system, we encourage short-term profiteering, conspicuous consumption, and reckless financial behaviour because we don't have the confidence that our money will keep its value in the future. On the other hand, a deflationary currency would encourage saving and spending only when necessary. Both have their laundry lists of pros and cons.

A key feature during deflationary spirals is the reduction of demand for that particular market. It could be the loss of confidence in the government (Turkish Lira was not heavily inflationary, yet the Lira tanked), sanctions by other nations (Iraq/Iran), other geopolitical black swan events. Switzerland enjoys currency stability, but also highly inflationary. It's more about the world's confidence in the currency which provides said currency its power rather than inflationary/deflationary designs. The more distrust the world has of the central bankers, the less stable their currencies are.

Bitcoin is deflationary by design, and completely predictable on the protocol layer. If the economy that uses Bitcoin grows, the per-unit value of Bitcoin proportionally increases also. On the other hand, deflationary spirals in fiat are unpredictable - sensitive to geopolitics and the decisions of the few. Another key difference is that fiat is debt-based, while Bitcoin is an asset - traditional economic models on deflationary spirals may not apply.

We'll see. If nothing else, the world needs to curb conspicuous consumption to be sustainable.",9,0,1538335060.0

6,"There's a lot of wrong thoughts about the usual currencies being ""inflationary"". Basically the banks try to reach stability, however the 2 percent inflation rate should help to keep up spending, it's not the big issue. The real sin was to go to the zero interest rates, which are against a stable logic of economy. There were times when a private guy could save money for an interest rate of 3 or 4 percent, overcompensating the inflation rate. With interest on interests, you could make 2000 bucks on top on interests within 10 years by saving only 100 per month. At zero risk! And for me it's also clear that borrowing money has to cost money (positive interest rate), this was the original business of stable and honest banks. So I am convinced that the people blaming the small inflation rate instead of the zero interest rate are barking at the wrong tree. It's good to see that the Fed, finally, is trying to get away again from the sick zero rate. 

And many people overlook that all banks do a lot of intervention at the markets every day to keep the currencies stable. Short-term stability of a currency is super important for day-to-day life, imagine that retail business is working on profit margins of 0.5 to 2 percent. So without intervention, currencies would jump up and down a bit more, and the mass psychology programmed into the trading computers would amplify these effects to make any currency look like today's crypto markets (not that strong of course, but for a major currency like USD or EUR, jumping 10 cents every day would be an economic nightmare already). 

Sorry for the long-winded foreword but it is important to see this first. Then finally, it's also important to look at the deflationary behavior of bitcoin. In a variation of Gresham's law, the deflationary currency will be held and not used in daily life, because you feel that you pay too much when using it. We see this with all the long-term ""hodlers"" just keeping it forever, waiting for the moon. I can see no way how people could be motivated to use a strongly deflationary currency in daily life, I guess they would rather go back to bartering or invent a substitute currency which is inflationary (see the principles of Gresham's law again). So the limited supply will be the really big issue: Instability could possibly be cured by mass adoption, but the deflationary approach will be even intensified by further adoption and will make the daily use more unlikely. So bitcoin's destiny by design is to be an asset for speculation. 


TL;DR It is not the small inflation rate but the illogical zero interest rate which puts economy at risk. Currencies are kept stable on short terms by intervention of the banks which is very important for economy. The deflationary design of bitcoin makes it a speculative asset rather than a currency, won't get better with further adoption, unfortunately. ",1,0,1538397408.0
7,"Let me start of by stating that I am a big believer that BTC will stand the test of time,however,the issue I am having is the ability to envision how that future will play out.Allow me to share my conundrum and I would appreciate any feedback or opinions on this matter.

When one looks at the history of money one can notice that every single one of them withoit exception is inflationary.From seashells to gold.The more valuable they become the more incemtives there are for people to either mine(in the case of gold) or simply provide resources to find them(in the case of seashells).Eventually,you will get to one of 2 points.Either an equilibrium between supply and demand is reached causing price stability or the currency proves itself to be unreliable due to high inflation(the supply of seashells is too unpredictable to be able to properly value it).Now comes Bitcoin where the laws of supply and demand is turned upside down.It doesnt matter how much demand there is,the supply will continuously decline as time goes by.The block rewards are set and it is expected to continue to decline.The Hashrate climbing only indicates the competition to mine and the rewards are set no matter what.So how can BTC ever reach a point of equilibrium in order for it to be a stable mean of transacting?I have seen articles with estimates of 1 to 100 million $,however,even at those levels,what can provide the counter weight to the deflationary character of BTC to prevent it from becoming so high that its use case becomes limited to people HODLING it forever.This argument can also apply to many other cryptocurrencies and I have yet to see a rational reasoning as to why BTC will not remain in a deflationary spiral forever.",19,1,1538325751.0

>Segwit is seen as a viable short-term solution that does not require increasing the block size. This workaround could buy time until the Lightning Network tech is ready for large-scale use and be implemented in a long-term solution.

It's not a work around as you say. It fixes the transaction malleability bug for a start and adds script versioning. List here: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/#script-versioning

>Until recently, whenever the Bitcoin blockchain network grew in users and transactions, the block-size was simply raised in order to keep up with demand. 

As someone else has pointed out, this wasn't the case. It was limited to 1MB max block size in 2010 and remained the same until Segwit applied block weight.

>Summer 2017 – fees rise to $1-5, which is too high to remain competitive.

Depends on what you see Bitcoin competing with. Fees are needed to provide funding incentives for the security miners provide as the coinbase block reward reduces over time. Bitcoin's value proposition is trustless, censorship resistant hard money, free from central control... not to be a cheap transport protocol for fiat. Probably also worth mentioning that the increased fee rate made many businesses look at how they interacted with the blockchain and led to them making process efficiency improvements. Batching having the greatest impact.

>If it wants to survive outside of being a censorship-resistant store of value, it will need to up its game massively.

Layers like the LN don't mean that your Bitcoin are moving outside of being a censorship resistant store if value, it builds on the base layer, leveraging its primitives to enable new use cases. I think your comment implies that layer 2 transactions abandon the properties of the base layer, when actually those properties underpin layer 2.

>Alice and Bob can send an unlimited amount of funds back and forth to each other 

It's limited by the channel capacity of course so maybe referencing the number of transactions would be more accurate.

>Each payment channel only requires 2 transactions on-chain

I think that's for testnet only. Main net requires more. Perhaps 6? Check the bolt.

>if his trusted friend Alice has a payment channel with the pizza shop, then Bob can still pay over the Lightning Network. 

It doesn't require trust. You can open channels with anyone who will accept them, no identity or trust required as they are backed by the Bitcoin transaction that opens the channel.

Just to note that this may change over time. It's advised for small payments only at the minute because it's still in its early stages.

&#x200B;

I have scoured the web on this... but it seems absolutely no one knows how to report this on a tax return, even hypothetically. It's simple if you take Bitcoin out of it. I probably would have gotten a W-2G and reported it that way. If not, it would be up to me to report it myself, and the IRS could see the withdraw/deposit on my bank statement should I ever get audited.

&#x200B;

But the anonymity of it all is throwing me for a loop. Bovada doesn't know who I am, or care, and also doesn't keep long term track of bet slips. So the official documentation consists of a bank withdrawl, a bit coin purchase, a bitcoin transfer, and then a bitcoin transfer back to be for a lot more than I had to begin with.

&#x200B;

There is no way for me to ""prove"" I won that money through gambling. There is no way for me to quantify and prove the change in value of bitcoin between the time I bought it and the time I got my winnings.

I kinda think bitcoin forms like ice.  


People who bought long ago are like vast permafrost ice sheets that haven’t melted in years, weathering any storm, maybe even willing to hold to 0 purely on cypherpunk principles rather than economic sense.  


Then you get a layer beginning from 2017, new ice but solid, been through some heavy storms but still forming at the top and willing to sell at some point, although if some didn’t at 3k, I don’t know what will make them sell.  


Then you have these new buys at at skyrocketing prices looking for continual gains, fresh snow and ice shards. Some will melt away, but a new layer of ice will surely form from the remains of every melt.

Since your dealing with a lot of $$ and you dont know what your doing, go and buy a brand new laptop/computer.

If you have the ability you should wipe/reinstall windows and delete any applications you dont need ON THE NEW COMPUTER YOU JUST BOUGHT.

Dont use your new computer for anything except securing this bitcoin.

Even better if you can use linux (im assuming your not familiar) or install windows from scratch.

Download the bitcoin core wallet on your brand new computer. Dont get scammed only download from [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) or the bitcoin github. Run bitcoin core until it is syncd with the blockchain.

Now plugin your old harddrive with the usb to sata converter you just bought and COPY the wallet.dat from your bitcoin core wallet on the old harddrive to your brand new computer and replace the empty wallet.dat that the bitcoin core wallet created with your old one.

You should now have your coins. You should make a new wallet and send your coins to that wallet, so you can claim all your forks like bch and stuff. Dont sweep or import private keys for forks until after you have moved your bitcoin to a new wallet you control.

The only real kinks you could run into is if you used bitlocker and dont have the recovery key in which case you will have to get your screen fixed and remember your old password.

The other one is if you used some other wallet, depending on what time you did this in 2011 I think the only real wallets available were bitcoin core or armory. If you used armory you probably wouldnt be posting this so ...

If it's a windows OS, the OS user passwords are just window dressing. You can gain access easily if you don't know the passkey.

Boot from your USB drive and then go to the ""computer"" dialog in the 'places' drop down (for GNU desktops like Ubuntu that is). You should be able to access the entire drive including the existing windows partition without a windows passkey. 

Navigate to your wallet, copy it to a separate USB, copy it again to a second USB, copy it once more? Shit, you can't back it up enough. 



Once the wallet.dat file is on your USB, transfer that usb to an existing OS on a persisitent drive (as in: don't do this in your live OS USB you created to gain access). Import the wallet.dat into your preferred desktop wallet and voila, now you just need to remember your passkey.",1,0,1561908001.0

You can buy a hard drive cloner on amazon for about 30 bucks, pay extra attention to the source (your laptop hard drive) and the target (the new drive), get this the wrong way round and you potentially erase the drive.

Once you have a clone, store the original somewhere safe.

Buy yourself a hardware wallet, either a trezor or a ledger.  Setup a wallet with a 25th seed, store your seeds safely.  Test that you can recover the wallet on the hardware device before committing.

On a new laptop with a fresh install, download and configure the bitcoin.org wallet, let it fully sync to the network.

Forget all networks and ensure it’s offline, then, connect the drive to the laptop (you can use the cloner to do this).  Browse the disk and find the wallet.dat file, copy that over the new one on the new laptop.  When you start the wallet hopefully you should see your coins in the wallet.

I would then do offline transactions from your laptop to the address of your new hardware wallet, copying the transactions on a brand new usb drive between the new (offline) laptop and another computer that you will use to broadcast.

Instead of you both actually swapping the two $10 notes at the end of each day, you both just keep your own note and consider it settled. 

This is called ""Cancelling out"" and is how a single transaction works on Lightning: you put $100 up, and as you buy stuff it get's cancelled out to the shopkeeper's benefit. As you're paid, your $100 gets reloaded from the shopkeeper's account. No notes actually change hands.

Now say you want to pay someone $40 to clean your car. Instead of paying them directly, Lightning *Network* means that they can get the $40 from the $100 you set up with the store. They now have $40 they can use at the store, and you have a clean car. Again, no actual money has had to change hands.

Money changing hands is what happens when something is added to the Blockchain. But just as there's a cost to handing over dollar notes (you gotta find it, they gotta check it) there's a cost in fees to add to the Blockchain. 

This cancelling out means just as you can save the time actually swapping notes, on the Blockchain you can save almost all the fees.",50,0,1561896112.0
1,"My favorite analogy is the beads on a string. 

Consider some coin with a hole in it like the 5 yen coin.

You and another person decide to do business together. You put a 50 coins on a string tied between you. Since it is your money, the coins are at your end. They have strings connecting to other people as well. 

You decide to spend 10 coins to someone on this network. You pass a note to your partner stating how much you want to send and where. They add their name and pass it along to another person down one of their strings. Repeat until it gets to the destination.

The destination announces they have a route and everyone on this route slides 10 coins at the same time. You have 10 less coins on your side. Everyone along the way has the name number. The destination has 10 more. 

Repeat this until you need those coins somewhere else. Then you and the other person tally up how many coins are on each side, cut the string, and divide them up.

It’s more complicated than that, but the analogy works to show it visually.",15,0,1561899596.0

3,"The analogy I like to use is the one of the bank teller versus the cash drawer. I came up with this during the bch split to explain why lightning was better than big blocks.

Before lightning, every time somebody wanted to make a transaction the shopkeeper or the buyer would essentially have to go to the bank, stand in line and wait for a teller, and then transfer the funds from their account to the other parties accounts.

As Bitcoin became more popular and more people wanted to use it, the lines at the banks got longer and longer. Sometimes, it would take hours to get to the teller where they could record the transaction in the central registry and confirm that funds had changed hands. Some people would slip a couple extra bucks to the security guard and they would get to cut in line. This generally pissed everybody off.

One solution was to add more tellers so that we could simultaneously handle more people at one time. This works for a while, but eventually your bank buildings get as large as city blocks and the lines still continue to grow. At some point, the streets get clogged with people waiting in line. The whole thing generally is not very scalable.

The other solution is to instead keep a cash drawer at each business. Businesses would go to the bank, withdraw some money, and commit a certain amount to that cash drawer at the beginning of the day. Over the course of the day, customers would pay money to the cash drawer and the business would pay money to its vendors out of the cash drawer. This whole time, nobody is reporting these transactions to the central bank. Nobody has to stand in a big line, everything is pretty much instant. Now, eventually the business is going to want to deposit it's accumulated income into the bank. At that time, they can go to the bank and do so. The lines should be relatively short because everyone else has a cash drawer so businesses only need to visit the bank a couple times a week. Consumers also get to visit the bank only once in a while. They carry a wallet with a little bit of cash that they can use just like the business uses their cash drawer.

In the end, it's pretty obvious to see that the second solution is the most scalable. As more people are added to the network, they can inherently keep their own wallets and cash drawers. The central register only has to accommodate the periodic transactions when an entity either takes money out to commit to its cash drawer or puts money in because they've grown a surplus.

I don't claim that this analogy is perfect. It has however helped me explain lightning to many people in the past in a suitable fashion, at least enough so that they'd understand the purpose of the technology.",3,0,1561920209.0
4,"""Lightning"" Network. You make it sound like we are a collective for bleaching each others' assholes.

LN is basically a way to stop writing every transaction to the blockchain, and instead lets us only write the net result of those transactions.

Say one day you & I do a bunch of business. I pay you 10 btc for something, then you pay me 7btc. Then I pay you 12, then you pay me 20 (imagine this exchange goes on for dozens of transactions). LN allows us to operate a tab, and only settle up on-chain once we're finished transacting. This saves fees & block space.

0,"1. A random number is generated from entropy - often thermal noise in hardware but other methods as well (like dice rolls). Lengths vary from 128 to 256 bits but 256 bits is most common (will correspond to 24 words in next step).

2. The random value is broken into 11 bit chunks (in the case of  [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)). Each 11 bit chunk is used as an index to a list of 2048 [standard words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). Different language versions exist. There is usually a partial chunk left over.

3. A sha256 checksum is calculated for the random value. The first bits of this (length determined by random value length) is added to the last partial data chunk to make a complete 11 bits. That is also looked up in the word list to make the final ""checksum word"".

4. That word list is given to users as backup.

5. The original random number is fed into a series of math processes ([hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)) to create a **master private key**. It is deterministic - meaning the same input value always gives back the same key.

6. That master key is passed thru another sequence of math processes to generate a sequence of single private and public keys (again deterministic). These make up your wallet address list.


The whole process is standardized in [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki). These docs give more complete and accurate details of math and example code. Various other BIP standards come into play for variants, derivation paths - things like segwit, bech32 etc.

About now you're thinking: ""**wtf? how can a random number be all there is to this**""???

2,"> 2.) Do wallets all use the same ‘formula’? If not, how would a different wallet make any sense out of my seed words and recover anything?  

No, but most modern wallets have converged on the [BIP39 standard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md), which is a list of 2048 english words. Some wallets might use a different list of words (LND wallet, f.ex), or non-english words (not aware of any software examples).  

> 3.) if they do all use the same ‘formula’ to generate/recover (sorry btw, to anyone with expertise, if me calling it a ‘formula’ is like nails on a chalkboard. I imagine it sounds dumb, I simply don’t have the vocab to say it any better, yet), then why aren’t some shady types just having banks of servers constantly running random word combinations through it?  

Many attempts have been already tried, and some people might still do it, but the expenses in energy, hardware and other resources are simply not worth it. Imagine you have to find a few atoms somewhere in the universe by simply guessing where they might be... Yeah, you might get lucky in theory, but the odds are unimaginable small. Like, really really really small (still possible though if your wallet totally sucks at producing randomness... which some old wallets were in the past. Imagine if you use your birthday date and encrypt it. The encryption is unbreakable, but it's still easy to simply guess).

4,"The average cost of electricity in the US is $0.12 per kWh. For a single server I'll use 3741kW annually as an estimate. That would be about 450$ per year per machine.

Let say you can do 10^14 decryption per second. That is 3.15x10^21 decrypts per year for one machine
You need to do (on average) 2^255 decryptions in a year, so you would need :
( 2^255 / 3.15x10^21) = 1.84x10^55 machines.

To figure your cost you would multiply that by 450$ and get about $8x10^57 or 8 octodecillion dollars.

-------

Why I think so: I saw a java script tool where you could enter the seed words and the tool generated the private master key and the individual private keys and pub keys and addresses from it.

You could als enter the private master key directly, and again it calculated individual priv&pub keys & addresses from it, but it could not generate the seed words from it.

But I don’t understand how the words are “generated” or how knowing them lets you recover anything. 

Everything I’ve read about hardware or software wallets just says the wallet “generates” a seed in case you need recovery. Hardware wallets even boast that the seed is generated inside your own hardware itself.  But HOW? By what mechanism/program/company is it generated and recovered? 

1.) The only thing that I can uneducatedly guess is that it (over-simplified I’m sure, but basically) starts with your private key and then puts it through an elaborate math ‘formula’ and that the answer to that math problem comes out as words and that becomes your seed... Then when you need recovery you put the words through the inverse of the formula and the result is a key?  Like a decoder ring on super-computer-steroids! Is that even close to right??? If not, ignore the questions below and please tell me how they are generated. But, If it is along that lines then...

2.) Do wallets all use the same ‘formula’? 
If not, how would a different wallet make any sense out of my seed words and recover anything? 
If so, why is it any more secure that a hardware wallet can generate internally, if every other wallet has the same ‘formula’ anyways?

3.) if they do all use the same ‘formula’ to generate/recover (sorry btw, to anyone with expertise, if me calling it a ‘formula’ is like nails on a chalkboard. I imagine it sounds dumb, I simply don’t have the vocab to say it any better, yet), then why aren’t some shady types just having banks of servers constantly running random word combinations through it? I imagine that targeting one person and trying to use that method to get a SPECIFIC seed would have truly staggeringly bad odds... But with all the wallets in all the world, would the odds still be so bad that they would stumble into a few random seeds to active wallets? What would be the defense against that?

S., at 472 (quoting Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325–326 (1979)). In light of this history and our established case law, we reiterate that the Commerce Clause by its own force restricts state protectionism.""

...""And Granholm never said that its reading of history or its Commerce Clause analysis was limited to discrimination against products or producers. On the contrary, the Court stated that the Clause prohibits state discrimination against all “‘out-of-state economic interests,’” Granholm, 544 U. S., at 472 (emphasis added), and noted that the direct-shipment laws in question “contradict[ed]” dormant Commerce Clause principles because they “de- prive[d] citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.” Id., at 473 (emphasis added).""

There is a section: ""Binding rulings"", with the following:

- BR Pub 19/01: Income tax – salary and wages paid in crypto-assets:  ""This ruling considers whether regular remuneration received by employees in crypto-assets is subject to PAYE.""
- BR Pub 19/02: Income tax – bonuses paid in crypto-assets: This ruling considers whether bonuses received by employees in crypto-assets are subject to PAYE.

So that's it.  This doesn't ""legalize"" anything.  This says whether certain types of income in bitcoin (and other ""cryptos"") are subject to a certain income tax.

14,"During the past years I always thought I could see some correlation between a terrible thing happening in the world, which might influence the market, and the price of Bitcoin. More specifically in most cases the Bitcoin price would rise while e.g. stock prices would fall.

In recent times we had or still have conflicts concerning:  
\- Hong Kong  
\- Iran and Strait of Hormuz, influencing oil trade which has always been a major driver of the economy  
\- We had our fair share of Trump activity which influenced Bitcoin prices, however the recent impeachment announcement didn't seem to have much of an impact  
\- There are messages of the population of Venezuela and the Central Bank hoarding Bitcoin however, for a population of 38 million people I would have thought this would have had a bigger impact in the price and more specifically transaction volume, as Venezuela could actually be one of the first places where it was actually used as a currency and not for HODLING.  
\- ECB started quantitative easing again while some (the Dutch and German) Central banks are fiercely against  
\- Last week there where messages about the US and QE or quietly printing 75 billion

Finally I think adoption rate after being around for more than a decade is (at least in the Netherlands) low. People do not know how to use it, are scared of using it, or don't see the importance of using it. One of the reasons contribution to a low adaption rate in the Netherlands I think is banks seeing some of the technological improvements of Bitcoin and implementing it. Of course banks do not and cannot implement all the good stuff from Bitcoin as it is simply not compatible with the banking system, they can however implement some nice features the fiat muggles care about most. Most predominantly fast transactions and have now also introduced it e.g. Tikkie (which is an app to transmit small transactions almost instantly).

While I still believe in Bitcoin and Blockchain, after all these years, and all this shit happening in the wold, if the rest of the fiat muggles still do not understand Bitcoin when will be the moment they do?

Considering low adoption rate and little to no price influence of recent events I start to lose trust in the growth of Bitcoin, in the growth of the Bitcoin price and finally in seeing Bitcoin as an investment.

An 80% decrease in other assets would really strike panic in at least US domestic markets if not global markets. Historical crashes are:
1) The Great Depression of the 1930’s hit a total of 86% percent down. 
2) The 60’s to the 80’s saw around a 70% stock market crash. 
3) The Dot Com Bubble of the 90’s saw a 40% crash. 
4) The Sub Prime Mortgage Loan Crisis of 2008 saw a 50% crash.... 

Bitcoin has seen 80% “crashes”. This is Bitcoin’s fourth rodeo. I’m not sure what other stock (let alone, asset) can withstand 80% “crashes” and come back stronger. The first alternative asset I think of is the AMZN stock which fell 70%~ during the Dot-Com bubble. AMZN fell from $85~ to I roughly $20. Now each AMZN stock is worth roughly $1,725. Amazon did this once.

Bitcoin has done this three times before. This is an anomaly of an asset. 

Pairing the A) economic circumstances and social normalization of the word “recession” in 2019, while the B) political environment is looking quite hectic. “Revolutions” are happening in Venezuela, Iran, Hong Kong, India/Bangladesh, multiple African countries... and do we dare forget that C) the federal reserve, not just the US Government, is facing troubling circumstances with BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Russia and China already bypassing the US Dollar taxes in trading with other countries like Iran. 

It is quite a blessing to be involved in a wonderful asset like Bitcoin as early as 2019. After tried and tested “crashes”, the entirety of Bitcoin does not collapse like any other stock would.

----------------------
Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets

Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.

Do not daytrade

Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 

Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well 

Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research

Do not invest your bitcoins in any investment schemes

9,"> Crucial advice for a beginner 

Welcome! First things first, do as much thorough personal research as possible before getting started in Bitcoin. The more familiar you can be with Bitcoin/the industry before buying, the better and more informed your decisions will be in the future. Research can include anything from reading articles, news, books etc to listening to Podcasts - whatever resources work best for you.

> What’s the best way? What do I need to know? 

Once you've done that \^ and feel comfortable with the topic, most beginners find it easier to buy from a Bitcoin exchange (an exchange is a company which sells Bitcoin, similar to foreign exchange companies). Which exchange you choose to use will be determined by where you live. For example, if you live in the UK/Europe, you might like to try buying [Bitcoin](https://www.coincorner.com/) from CoinCorner. We're an exchange that was founded in 2014.

Yes you should double check every letter and number when giving someone an address to send to. It is money they are sending, treat it as such.

No you dont need to be logged in for the transaction to complete. Tell the exchange to send to the address you generated, they should make you double check and confirm it. Then you will see the coin in your ledger wallet next time you login.",1,0,1569892705.0

6,"The 24 words is to recover your hardware wallet if it's damaged or lost.  Write it down.  Put it in a safe place.  It's not to be used, generally speaking, any other time.   Your ledger can be protected by a pin.   The protection of physical ownership + pin is enough for most people.    Wallets containing $50 should be secured differently than wallets containing $5M.   Wallets intended to be touched often should be optimized for access with reasonable security.   Wallets that you touch once every 5 years on a long term investment can be optimized purely for security. 

You just need to familiarize with yourself with how the system works.

1. the owner of bitcoin in an address has a private key (think of it like a password that can be used to authenticate ownership of an address)
2. if you have that private key, you can transfer the bitcoin to another address.
3. private keys don't need to be stored in a hardware wallet, but it's scary if it's in a place easily accessible by software.
4. hardware wallets let you store it on a device and request signatures rather than the key be returned to the software.   This protects you since you can confirm on the device the way the software wants to use the private key.

Bitcoin is always in the cloud.   Once the system receives your transaction it will be processed.   Your PC is irrelevant.   ledgerlive is a nice little interface to access addresses and to sign transactions from your addresses.    As far as sending bitcoin from an exchange to your device, you just need to know one of your wallet addresses.   You don't even have to turn on your PC for that.   I have some written down.

Best practice is to generate a new address whenever you receive money -- it'll do that automatically in ledger live when you want to receive money there.   But old addresses work just fine.",1,0,1569925561.0
7,"Keep in mind that your bitcoins aren't stored on your computer, and neither are your transactions. They are stored in the blockchain. Your wallet has the keys to access them.

In the 1800s no one used the terms inflation or deflation

Corporations only existed in the US for about 6 years when this quote is attributed, and the first large corporations weren't really around til the 1920s and were industrial.

The syntax is also horrible and clearly altered, 'the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks...' the banks that will grow up around the banks? Doesn't make sense.

Lastly, the actual context of the quotes that were altered and cut and pasted together was that he was arguing in favour of central banks, a part cut out of one part of the quote with is from 1813 is ' Bank paper money must be suppressed and the circulation medium restored to the nation. ' At the time banks could issue their own currency notes and he was arguing that it should be run by a central bank controlled by the country.

[Bitcoin Vaults](https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/02/26/how-to-implement-secure-bitcoin-vaults/) will make this much easier to do. A Bitcoin vault is a multisig wallet where the more keys you use, the faster the transaction can be finalized. This allows the user to recover their money even if they've lost 4 out of 5 keys, and allows the user to stop an attempted theft that stole 4 out of 5 keys (as long as they still have access to all 5 keys). This is basically the holy grail of wallet security.

So in the future, it could be this simple for a new user:

1. Download an app
2. Create a seed with the app and a passphrase
3. Choose 2 seed services and give each some information they can use to verify you
4. Create a wallet using those seeds

The app would have a lightning wallet and a vault wallet, and sending from your vault wallet would take a few days to a week (time for you to reverse a theft attempt). If you lose your keys (eg if you didn't back up your seed and lost your phone), you could use one of your seed services to recover the funds. If someone discovers your seed, you can use the seed in your app plus one of the seed services (or both services) to reverse the theft. You'd probably have to call the seed services so they can verify that it's you and go through their security procedures, including probably verifying your location in case they decide you're in danger (eg being taken hostage).

This is still slightly more complicated than creating one account with one bank and letting them manage everything. And people will probably do that too, and that's kind of ok as long as we maintain the ability for people to own their own keys.",7,0,1585674271.0

On one hand, mankind managed to get used to using things like phone numbers... a whole string of numbers to memorize is quite unwieldy compared to today's ease-of-use standards. And people learned math (which is quite a complex system) even at a basic level. 

So this somewhat shows people can learn complexity if it is a necessity.

On the other hand, people have been spoiled beyond belief by modern tech, and there are also other alternatives (for now) that are much more convenient, like fiat-based online payment systems (until inflation hits anyway). I remember when the internet was dial-up with lots of screeching noises, that was quite widespread adoption, but nothing compared to smartphones in your hand.

I think it can still reach widespread adoption even at its current complexity, but nothing like ""smartphone adoption level"" until it becomes extremely easy to use (things like addresses, fees, and confirmation times [if on the base layer] being completely invisible to the user).

16,"""After recently seeing the posts about the 21 Million Club and the media write-up about it, I decided to do some digging into the numbers.

As many of you know, the 21 Million Club is a Reddit designation for those Bitcoiners that own 1 BTC or more. The 21 million is reference to the fact that only 21 million BTC will ever be in circulation. However, the designation makes it seem like (especially for newcomers) that there is or can be up to 21,000,000 in this club. Well let's check that and get a real estimate for the number of people in this exclusive club.

We know that there will only ever be 21,000,000 in circulation. However, there are 16,724,975 in circulation as of 12/5/17 according to the most recent data from blockchain[dot]info.

We know from recent studies that there are many bitcoins that are lost forever. I removed the Satoshi coins from the studies and averaged the difference to get an estimate of lost coins, which came to 2,304,824.

So, there are only 16,724,975 - 2,304,824 = 14,420,151 BTC, and therefore only a potential of 14.4 million current 21 Million Club members.

But let's dig deeper into what we know from the blockchain.

Satoshi is believed to have a stash of approximately 980,000. We will assume this as one BTC address and one person.

We can also see the largest holders on the blockchain. These are logged on bitinfocharts[dot]com. You can google ""top 100 richest bitcoin addresses"" and the site will provide the top 9900 BTC addresses. These 9,900 people account for an estimated wopping 9,870,340 BTC!

So, 14,420,151 [existing BTC] - 980,000 [satoshi BTC] - 9,870,340 [top 9900 BTC addresses] = 3,569,811 BTC. This means that 9,901 addresses hold roughly 78.65% of all the BTC that exists right now. That reduced our 21 Million Club members to 3,569,811 + 9901 = 3,579,711.

But let's dig deeper into some formulas to determine trends since many accounts have more than 1 BTC.

I took the top accounts with a maximum of 10000 BTC and plotted them on a power trendline coming up with the following equation:

y = 11880x -0.925

This formula allowed me to plot the rest of the addresses in 100 address groups. Using that formula and adjusting for the maximum BTC left, we can assume there are 801,713 addresses w/ 1 BTC - 156 BTC. Keep in mind this assumes no addresses with sub-1 BTC.

So, 9901 [largest address holders including Satoshi] + 801,713 [addresses w/ 1 BTC - 156 BTC] = 811,514 Addresses w/ 1 BTC Minimum.

So, the ABSOLUTE LARGEST estimate for the number of people in the 21 Million Club is 811,514. However, it is likely much much lower for the following reasons: 1) The analysis does not account for fractional BTC ownership at all, which is likely a very large portion of the BTC addresses, 2) It does not account for people that may control multiple addresses, which would further reduce the membership, and finally, 3) As time goes on the only people that will be able to purchase 1 BTC will reduce as the price goes up, making fractional ownership more common.

EDIT 1: The number also doesn't take into account distributed ownership. This could distribute in a number of ways but it would likely follow the same curve used for the estimate.

If you are part of the 811,514 or less, consider yourself lucky. You are in the top 0.01% globally. I saw this reported earlier as 0.3% globally, which is WAY OFF.""",83,1,1585697820.0

Very bad idea.  You should never choose a key, it should always be generated by a good random number source. 

The purpose of mnemonics is to help you memorize your keys, and nothing more. While they do make it much easier to communicate keys, that is not the primate purpose. Its just an accidental byproduct of the FEC built into human language - its good for communication purposes because of the built in redundancies - the same ones which help memorization.

Even more so, now that you've posted your idea here, the thousands of hackers constantly searching for keys generated in idiotic ways will add song lyrics and methods of such generation to their search parameters.

It is insanely important to generate a truly random address. 

I can't find them now, but there have been several posts around 2011-2015 of people who lost coin because they thought it would be a good idea to use quotes from books or poems as their seed phrase. Even if you add more layers of protection/ randomness, you will not be able to do a good enough job to be confident in the long-term.

Addemdun: this is assuming, of course, that you pick a random song, which you won't. You will pick a common song from the top 10,000 or even 1,000,000 of the past 100 years, reducing search space even further.",1,0,1585844898.0
