You mention a lot about yourself here and your past performance, however little about your case for purchasing ELO. I may be wrong, but this indicates to me you might not have a strong case (if so, please share your thesis so we can poke holes at it). 

Don't look at your past 'mistakes' - you didn't put more into them as you couldn't tolerate the risk. If you can afford the $2000 now - i.e. losing it wouldn't be the end of the world - (idk your financial situation fully), and fully back the company (you don't mention anything about why you want to buy ELO), then there's no reason why you shouldn't buy more of this stock. 

But the key thing is, know why you are buying - it's got to be a fairly solid thesis imo - have an expectation of what you'd like the company to achieve in 6 months time (or whenever) and continually assess. ",0.4015775,0.49762872,0.10079382,8.0,0.0

I had never heard to ELO 5 minutes ago.  Looking at the H1 FY18 accounts.... Revenue 10m. Profit(loss) -$0.6m.  NTA $54m.

Current Market Value $314m

75% of the shares are own by three shareholders (presumably related in some way - not institutions).  ELO have purchased other companies - never a good sign for tightly held companies.

I will never look at this company again.  Nothing in the first 5 minutes of looking at this shows me anything remotely interesting.   

So, give me just one reason why I should even spend time looking this company.

These are both speculation, you are guessing which way the market is going to go which no one knows. If you are going to try to time entry/exit with long or short positions you need to be conscious of what you are doing. This is VERY different to a buy and hold strategy (a bet that the market will rise in the very long term)

For everyone that wants to buy, do so slowly over time. Don't pick the bottom and don't put your entire lump sum in now. History tells us lump sum and DCA work out very similar but good luck sleeping through your entire lump sum experiencing 3-6% daily losses/gains.

If your looking at what is best strictly from a financial point of view, I would just stick it in a savings account with a 2% or higher interest rate (some quick google-fu will help you find some) and watch your nest egg grow with regular deposits. The benefit of having an emergency fund cannot be overstated, its MUCH easier to pull some cash out of your savings to pay for a surprise ambulance bill than it is to sell stock at a potential loss then wait for the transfer out.

TLDR: Save up for a bigger initial investment after first accumulating an emergency fund if your doing this to be smart with money. Throw it into the market if your looking to have some fun and gain some experience in how you can react in a volatile market.",0.033357803,0.28286603,0.6837762,1.0,0.0

68,0.0,"I took about a month, reading up on what platforms were best to use and why, understanding some commonly used terms by googling them (ex-dividend date, PE ratio etc).

Honestly most of the learning comes from doing and experience. You'll slowly (or quickly if you're lucky) work out what strategy works for you.

For example, I spent a lot of time reading financial reports to understand what qualities in a company I liked (healthy gross margin, limited debt or at least healthy debt coverage with cash and receivables, steady revenue growth), and that'll differ from investor to investor (some people don't like companies who hold cash because it can appear like the company doesn't know how to invest it and it's a waste, for example).

I think a few consistent things I've been recommended and recommend to others are:

* Never invest funds that you wouldn't be okay if it hit zero (which can happen!)
* Invest in what you know and can understand. I too bought A2M as another commenter. I bought it because I could see a lot of my friends were developing lactose intolerances (which didn't seem to be much of a discussed issue a decade or two earlier), baby formula was a big thing (still is) and they didn't have a crazy amount of debt. Ticked my boxes and I went in. People were hyping Lithium miners when I started investing, and I didn't understand how valuations could work for a miner who was prospecting and didn't actually dig any minerals out of the ground yet. They went boom and now look at most of them. You don't need to have a crystal ball, but if you can understand a business and how their prospects apply to everyday life, it's not a bad way to start looking at companies. It's like, if you think the housing market is in trouble now, would you invest in [realestate.com.au](https://realestate.com.au)? No right?
* Stick to your convictions, but know when to pull the pin. Set a bottom out price that you're willing to weather on the chance you got an assumption about a company wrong, and also set an upward sell price (even if it's only taking your cost off the table). Everything in between is you riding the ups and downs of sentiment changes
* Just because something is at an all time low, doesn't mean it's cheap and a good buy. Also, just because something is at an all time high, doesn't mean it won't come down. People are looking at big blue chips at the moment because of the market downturn, everything's become ""cheap"". But little to no economic data has come out yet to back up valuations right now, so it's hard to say whether these are truly cheap or not. You might buy CBA today at $60 because it's the biggest bank and not long ago it was $90, so it should survive right? Well it goes back to point 2, if you don't know enough about the bank and how it makes money, not worth risking the money simply because it's at 52 week lows
* If you're not confident, start with Index ETFs (google the definition!). They are way safer and gives you diversity amongst companies and markets (vs investing in a single ASX company)
* Never trust stock picking advice from others. They are just as good/bad as you are, the difference is experience levels (but experience is not always a good thing). I've been told so many stock tips over the years, in businesses I don't understand, because it was what was ""hot"". Most of those have collapsed (or at least share price has) since. Use these stock tips to broaden your horizon for businesses to research and understand.

I have an odd question regarding my AVH shares. On my CommSec account I currently hold 1,000 AVHDA shares (or CDIs... the whole redomicile process is new territory for me).

AVITA THERAPEUTICS,INC. (AVH)

1) Can I convert my AVHDA to ASX: AVH? I would much prefer to hold my shares as ordinary fully paid. 

2) If the above answer is ""no"", how do I sell these shares for when I decide it's time? The AVHDA listing is showing as chi-x suspended with not a single unit moving today. However ASX:AVH has been active all day. 

I could be jumping the gun with these questions as the new AVH listing is showing as ""reconstructed"".  I'm just concerned that I may have done something wrong on my end and will be stuck with these CDI units.",0.5302834,0.4200232,0.049693346,3.0,1.0

Problem is, this piece of legislation doesn't exist having been repealed some years ago, so small business owners are saying the exclusion doesn't apply and IAG must replace their lost revenue caused by the covid lockdowns. There will be a court case to decide if IAG, and other insurers in a similar situation, will have to pay up.

FWIW, Wilson thinks the market is overestimating the costs that may arise from this issue and thinks the stock will go up when the issue is resolved.

We'd like to have the ownership shared of this investment vehicle (i.e. not have two separate trading accounts mirrored) and although there are options for two individuals to have a joint trading account (with associated checks and balances), one of us has a trust. For asset protection purposes it makes sense to have the trust have 50% ownership of this investment vehicle.

My question is - is there a trading platform that enables investment in Australian Equities and ETF's by way of a joint trading account, part-owned by both an individual and a trust?

Otherwise, is there another way that we can both co-own an investment vehicle like this, with the trust/person part-ownership construct?
