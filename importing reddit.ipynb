      "A Taproot activation mechanism called \"[Speedy Trial](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/speedy-trial-merged-into-bitcoin-core)\" has just started on the 1st of May. Its goal is to give miners an opportunity to coordinate a quick activation of the Taproot update.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The gist of it is: miners are given a three months time period to signal for Taproot activation. Within those three months, there are six sub-phases (each consists of 2016 blocks, aka ~2 weeks). As soon as there are 90% of blocks signalling for Taproot within *any of those six sub-phases*, Taproot activation will be locked in. The actual new protocol rules will then be enforced starting from block height 709,632, which is expected to be mined in November.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We are currently in the ~~first~~ second of those six sub-phases, and Taproot activation will not happen in this one, as miners need time to upgrade their equipment (this is expected, as the software update with Taproot activation mechanism was only [released a few days ago](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-0-21-1-taproot-code-out)). But already now (as of 16th of May) there is roughly ~90% of mining power that has updated and started signalling for Taproot in at least some of their blocks. Keep in mind that 90% of blocks within one difficulty adjustment period (we're currently in the second of six of those periods) need to be signalling. This likely will be achieved when the signalling pools switch from signalling in some of their blocks to signalling permanently.  \n",

      "\n",
      "There is an update to bitcoin's code, called Taproot. It is good for privacy and efficiency of some important usecases. The update itself (the code) is ready, now it needs to be activated on the network. The developers/users gave the miners three months time to coordinate this activation (the coordination through miners makes it a bit easier, if everyone cooperates).  \n",
      "\n",
      "That three months time window started on the 1st of May, and this current thread is keeping track of the current activation status. Now we have to wait and see how cooperative the miners will be (most likely they will, but it's not a guarantee).   \n",
      "\n",
      "> **If 90% is not reached by August, what then? Is Taproot dead?**  \n",
      "\n",
      "No, if miners are not cooperating, then another activation mechanism will be attempted (probably something similar to UASF in 2017), where full node maintainers simply say \"from blockheight x Taproot will be enforced and non-compliant blocks will be rejected\", or something similar. The \"speedy trial\" mechanism was just the least contentious/the fastest one. If it doesn't work, we move on to another mechanism.    \n",

      "\n",
      "Taproot is a soft fork, which means it is backwards compatible. Non-updated nodes will be able to stay on the network (and upgrade at their leisure at some point or not), but they won't be able to \"understand\" what Taproot is (afaik they'll see Taproot transactions as \"anyone can spend\" transactions, which are still fully valid by the bitcoin rules).   \n",
